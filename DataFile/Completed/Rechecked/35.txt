merchant. " does your brother know, then, of what you will do? i asked. " the plan is his. he has devised it. we will go to the
gate and share the watch with mahomet singh. "the rain was still falling steadily, for it was just the beginning of the wet season. brown, heavy clouds were
drifting across the sky, and it was hard to see more than a stone-cast. a deep moat lay in front of our door, but the water was in
places nearly dried up, and it could easily be crossed. it was strange to me to be standing there with those two wild punjaubees waiting for the man
who was coming to his death. "suddenly my eye caught the glint of a shaded lantern at the other side of the moat. it vanished among the mound-heaps,
and then appeared again coming slowly in our direction. " here they are! i exclaimed. " you will challenge him, sahib, as usual, whispered abdullah. give him no
cause for fear. send us in with him, and we shall do the rest while you stay here on guard. have the lantern ready to uncover, that we
may be sure that it is indeed the man. "the light had flickered onwards, now stopping and now advancing, until i could see two dark figures upon the
other side of the moat. i let them scramble down the sloping bank, splash through the mire, and climb half-way up to the gate, before i challenged them.
" who goes there? said i, in a subdued voice. " friends, came the answer. i uncovered my lantern and threw a flood of light upon them. the
first was an enormous sikh, with a black beard which swept nearly down to his cummerbund. outside of a show i have never seen so tall a man.
the other was a little, fat, round fellow, with a great yellow turban, and a bundle in his hand, done up in a shawl. he seemed to be
all in a quiver with fear, for his hands twitched as if he had the ague, and his head kept turning to left and right with two bright
little twinkling eyes, like a mouse when he ventures out from his hole. it gave me the chills to think of killing him, but i thought of the
treasure, and my heart set as hard as a flint within me. when he saw my white face he gave a little chirrup of joy and came running
up towards me. " your protection, sahib, he panted,-- your protection for the unhappy merchant achmet. i have travelled across rajpootana that i might seek the shelter of
the fort at agra. i have been robbed and beaten and abused because i have been the friend of the company. it is a blessed night this when
i am once more in safety,--i and my poor possessions. " what have you in the bundle? i asked. " an iron box, he answered, which contains one
or two little family matters which are of no value to others, but which i should be sorry to lose. yet i am not a beggar; and i
shall reward you, young sahib, and your governor also, if he will give me the shelter i ask. "i could not trust myself to speak longer with the
man. the more i looked at his fat, frightened face, the harder did it seem that we should slay him in cold blood. it was best to get
it over. " take him to the main guard, said i. the two sikhs closed in upon him on each side, and the giant walked behind, while they
marched in through the dark gate-way. never was a man so compassed round with death. i remained at the gate-way with the lantern. "i could hear the measured
tramp of their footsteps sounding through the lonely corridors. suddenly it ceased, and i heard voices, and a scuffle, with the sound of blows. a moment later there
came, to my horror, a rush of footsteps coming in my direction, with the loud breathing of a running man. i turned my lantern down the long, straight
passage, and there was the fat man, running like the wind, with a smear of blood across his face, and close at his heels, bounding like a tiger,
the great black-bearded sikh, with a knife flashing in his hand. i have never seen a man run so fast as that little merchant. he was gaining on
the sikh, and i could see that if he once passed me and got to the open air he would save himself yet. my heart softened to him,
but again the thought of his treasure turned me hard and bitter. i cast my firelock between his legs as he raced past, and he rolled twice over
like a shot rabbit. ere he could stagger to his feet the sikh was upon him, and buried his knife twice in his side. the man never uttered
moan nor moved muscle, but lay were he had fallen. i think myself that he may have broken his neck with the fall. you see, gentlemen, that
