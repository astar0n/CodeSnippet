<p>work or conduct business only because they are after the money. They enioy their work or their business. They find pleasure in</p>
<p>it. And this is the true meaning of capitalism: the abolition of the artificial distinction between work and leisure and the pursuit</p>
<p>of both with the same zeal and satisfaction. Above all, the (increasing) liberty to do so whenever, wherever, with whomever you choose.</p>
<p>Lies and Lying All people lie some of the time. They use words to convey their lies while their body language usually</p>
<p>gives them away. This is curious. why did evolution prefer this self defeating strategy? The answer lies in the causes of the</p>
<p>phenomenon, we lie for three main reasons and these give rise to three categories of lies: 1. The Empathic Lie - is</p>
<p>a lie told with the intention of sparing someone s feelings. "it is a face saving lie - but someone else s</p>
<p>face. "N is designed to prevent a loss of social status, the onslaught of social sanctions, the process of /udgement involved in</p>
<p>both. "It is a derivative o our ability to put ourselves in someone else s shoes - that is, to empathize. "it</p>
<p>is intended to spare OUR feelings, which are bound to turn more and more unpleasant the more we sympathize with the social-mental</p>
<p>predicament of the person lied to. The reverse, brutal honesty, at all costs and in all circumstances - is a form of</p>
<p>sadistic impulse. The lie achieves its goal only if the recipient cooperates, does not actively seek the truth out and acquiescently participates</p>
<p>in the mini-drama unfolding in his honour. 2. The Egocentric Lie - is a lie intended to further the well being of</p>
<p>the liar. This can be achieved in one of two ways. The lie can help the liar to achieve his goals (a</p>
<p>Goal Seeking Lie} or to avoid embarrassment, humiliation, social sanctions, iudgement, criticism and, in general, unpleasant experiences related to social standing {a</p>
<p>Face Saving Lie). The Goal Seeking Lie is useful only when considering the liar as an individual, independent unit. The Face Saving</p>
<p>type is instrumental only in social situations. we can use the terms: Vndividualistic Lie and Social Lie respectively. 3. The Narcissistic Lie</p>
<p>- is separated from his brethren by its breadth and recursiveness, "It is all-pervasive, ubiquitous, ever recurring, all encompassing, entangled and intertwined</p>
<p>with all the elements of the liar s life and personality. Moreover, it is a lie of whose nature the liar is</p>
<p>not aware and he is convinced of its truth. But the people surrounding the Narcissist liar notice the lie. The Narcissist-liar is</p>
<p>rather like a hunchback without a mirror. He does not believe in the reality of his own hump. "it seems that where</p>
<p>the liar does not believe his own lies - he succeeds in convincing his victims rather effectively, when he does believe in</p>
<p>his own inventions - he fails miserably at trapping his fellow men. Much more about the False Self (the lie that underlies</p>
<p>the personality of the Narcissist) in "Malignant Self Love - Narcissism Revisited" and the FAQ section thereof. Life, Human The preservation of</p>
<p>human life is the ultimate value, a pillar of ethics and the foundation of all morality. This held true in most cultures</p>
<p>and societies throughout history. On first impression, the last sentence sounds patently wrong. we all know about human collectives that regarded human</p>
<p>lives as dispensable, that murdered and tortured, that cleansed and annihilated whole populations in recurrent genocides. Surely, these defy the aforementioned statement."</p>
<p>Liberal philosophies claim that human life was treated as a prime value throughout the ages. Authoritarian regimes do not contest the over-riding</p>
<p>importance of this value. Life is sacred, valuable, to be cherished and preserved. 8ut, in totalitarian societies, it can be deferred, subsumed,</p>
<p>subiected to higher goals, quantized, and, therefore, applied with differential rigor in the following circumstances: 1. Quantitative - when a lesser evil</p>
<p>prevents a greater one. Sacrificing the lives of the few to save the lives of the many is a principle enshrined and</p>
<p>embedded in activities such as war and medicinal care. All cultures, no matter how steeped (or rooted) in liberal lore accept it.</p>
<p>They all send soldiers to die to save the more numerous civilian population. Medical doctors sacrifice lives daily, to save others. It</p>
<p>is boils down to a quantitative assessment ("the numerical ratio between those saved and those sacrificed"), and to questions of quality ("are</p>
<p>there privileged lives whose saving or preservation is worth the sacrifice of others lives?") and of evaluation (no one can safely predict</p>
<p>the results of such moral dilemmas - will lives be saved as the result of the sacrifice."). 2. Temporal - when sacrificing</p>
<p>life (voluntarily or not) in the present secures a better life for others in the future. These future lives need not be</p>
<p>more numerous than the lives sacrificed. A life in the future immediately acquires the connotation of youth in need of protection. It</p>
<p>is the old sacrificed for the sake of the new, a trade off between those who already had their share of life</p>
<p>- and those who hadn t. "it is the bloody equivalent of a savings plan: one defers present consumption to the future.</p>
<p>The mirror image of this temporal argument belongs to the third group {see next), the qualitative one. "it prefers to sacrifice a</p>
<p>life in the present so that another life, also in the present, will continue to exist in the future. Abortion is an</p>
<p>instance of this approach: the life of the child is sacrificed to secure the future well-being of the mother. "In ﬂudaism, it</p>
<p>is forbidden to kill a female bird. Better to kill its off-spring. The mother has the potential to compensate for this loss</p>
<p>of life by bringing giving birth to other chicks. 3. Qualitative - This is an especially vicious variant because it purports to</p>
<p>endow subiective notions and views with "scientific" obiectivity. People are iudged to belong to different qualitative groups (classified by race, skin color,</p>
<p>birth, gender, age, wealth, or other arbitrary parameters). The result of this immoral taxonomy is that the lives of the "lesser" brands</p>
<p>of humans are considered less "weighty" and worthy than the lives of the upper grades of humanity. The former are therefore sacrificed</p>
<p>to benefit the latter. The Fews in Nazi occupied Europe, the black slaves in America, the aborigines in Australia are three examples</p>
<p>of such pernicious thinking. 4. Utilitarian - when the sacrifice of one life brings another person material or other benefits. This is</p>
<p>the thinking {and action) which characterizes psychopaths and sociopathic criminals, for instance, For them, life is a tradable commodity and it can</p>
<p>be exchanged against inanimate goods and services. Money and drugs are bartered for life. Life, Right to I. The Right to Life</p>
<p>Generations of malleable Vsraeli children are brought up on the story of the misnamed ﬂewish settlement Tel-Hai ("Mount of Life"), "Israel s</p>
<p>Alamo. There, among the picturesque valleys of the Galilee, a one-armed hero named ioseph Trumpeldor is said to have died, eight decades</p>
<p>ago, from an Arab stray bullet, mumbling: "it is good to die for our country." Iudaism is dubbed "A Teaching of Life"</p>
<p>- but it would seem that the sanctity of life can and does take a back seat to some overriding values.</p>
