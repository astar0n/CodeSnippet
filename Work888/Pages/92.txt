<p>dead. but this is the dungeon where pirithoos lay to be scratched by me during a hundred years." now there</p>
<p>is nothing more terrible than such an impudent female as this. wherefore, having prepared a wile, not to enrage her,</p>
<p>but to delude her, by seeming to be overcome by piety and terror, then, i let my mouth gape like</p>
<p>a fool s while i repeated after her: "a hundred years!" but she began to be garrulous. but i watched</p>
<p>for an opportunity of entangling her in her talk. and thus she chattered: "yea, here indeed lay pirithoos, son of</p>
<p>ixion, during a hundred years. for king hades would not give him to sweet death, so black was his crime.</p>
<p>but, every night, we sisters three tormented his body as though he were dead, using fiery tortures and nail-tearings, until</p>
<p>the decree came that his shade should repose in peace, being purged. but thou, also, o much-enduring odysseys, will lie</p>
<p>here, chained, purging thy presumptuous prepotence: but, not till after thy death, may we deal with thee according to thy</p>
<p>doom, whatever that may be." and, having thus enlightened me, the very excessive fury suddenly left me, with extempore shrieks</p>
<p>and a flapping of her skinny wings, thereafter, i forget how some days passed: for a prisoner may not reckon</p>
<p>the flight of time in the region of tartaros, excepting by marking the ebb and flow of the fiery tides</p>
<p>of pyriphthlegethon. moreover, i was occupied in my mind, reviewing all my store of magic wisdom and contriving many wiles.</p>
<p>and, by chance, one day, i became aware that i was hearing a song; and the sound of it seemed</p>
<p>to come from very far away, sweetly, like the voice of a cicada drunk on dewdrops, which, in the woods,</p>
<p>sitting on a tree, sends forth a delicate lily-like voice. now, in the house of shady hades {most righteous of</p>
<p>gods}, this is the Condition of mortals when they are dead. for their nerves have no longer flesh and bones:</p>
<p>but the strong force of burning fire subdues them, when first the mind leaves the white bones; and the soul,</p>
<p>gibbeting like a dream, flits and flutters away. wherefore, the souls of the dead cannot sing, nor do they attempt</p>
<p>it, being occupied in shrieking with agony and fear. for which cause, i was vastly amazed to hear so very</p>
<p>sweet a song, so grave, so quiet in tone." and, having summoned all my strength, despite the weighty manacles which</p>
<p>trammelled me, i leaped up to the high barred window which looked out into the gloom. but i saw little</p>
<p>more than that my dungeon was a pit in a rocky height: for it happened to be the hour of</p>
<p>slack tide, when the flames of pyriphthlegethon die down for a while. and the wonderful song came more clearly from</p>
<p>below, thrilling the darkness of black night. but, when, anon, the voice was silent, i wedged myself {as best i</p>
<p>could} into the narrow alcove of the window, waiting for the ebb of the tide, when i might see more</p>
<p>plainly in the light of the increscent flames, and, when the flickering gleam of the fires leaped up, i saw</p>
<p>that my pit was a cell in a watch-tower perched high above the walls of the house of blameless hades,</p>
<p>but there was a great gulph fixed below, and bleak meadows beyond, swept by mists and winds of hell. and,</p>
<p>while i gazed, the lily-like Voice began again to ring, maidenlike, very solemn, and of entrancing sweetness, but i, listening,</p>
<p>heard it; and the heart in my dear breast thrilled strangely: for it seemed as though memory (that divine one</p>
<p>of goddesses} was opening yet once more certain chambers in my mind, unknown, or unremembered; and i was aware of</p>
<p>treasures stored therein, whose very existence i had forgotten. but the simple song went sadly on, as though the singer</p>
<p>sat in patience waiting, singing only just to pass the time, but always with hope, very faint indeed but never-failing,</p>
<p>ever-enduring, in the depth of her maiden breast. and thus she sang: waiting, till, on his breast, she bursts in</p>
<p>full flower. and the strange sweet dancing rhythm made my pulses bound; and my breath came quickly in accord. for</p>
<p>it was like a sudden- blazing thunderbolt illuminating the recesses of my mind; and i remembered the object of my</p>
<p>quest, to wit, golden helen, who, when i was not much more than a boy, had watched me faring girded</p>
<p>high through the ford of eyrotas near windy laltedaimon" golden helen, whom her star-crowned brothers (kastor the tamer of horses</p>
<p>and polydeykes the pugilist) had rescued from the blameless hero theseys carrying her away when she was a tender girl,--golden</p>
<p>helen, whom king tyndareys had given in so-called marriage to loud-shouting impotent old sandy-haired menelaos, blameless, and blubber-lipped,--golden helen, whom</p>
<p>woman-mad paris had reft from her farcical husband,--golden helen, who had come again to me in the land of khem,</p>
<p>long ages since, pure as snow or fire, and always mine alone,--golden helen, whom black fate had reft from me,</p>
<p>when i died that time by the sacred river of egypt, being wounded to death by blameless kirke s son</p>
<p>and mine, unknowing telegonos. but now, indeed, i knew of a truth that golden helen was that very treasure of</p>
<p>hades which i had come to win: for, by favour of queen persephone, she was safe in the netherworld, and</p>
<p>only there, for in the netherworld there are no men capable of worrying a lady, but merely shades of men,</p>
<p>who are quite negligible; and, there, she (being immortal} could live faithful to me and not altogether without certain amenities.</p>
<p>wherefore, with a great shout, i called her by name. and she made answer, half-amazed and half-afraid, saying: "who calleth</p>
<p>me with the voice of one long dead?" to whom i replied: "i am odysseys, grandson of hermes, victor over</p>
<p>all sorts of people," and i am come here for thee, o high-born long-robed helen whom i love." thus</p>
<p></p>
