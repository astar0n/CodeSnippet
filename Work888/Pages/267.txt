<p>cleopatra in the inner room of the temple of horus, at philae. with such a record at the age of thirty-one, it was felt that a considerable career</p>
<p>lay before him, and no one was surprised when he was elected to the curatorship of the belmore street museum, which carries with it the lectureship at the</p>
<p>oriental college, and an income which has sunk with the fall in land, but which still remains at that ideal sum which is large enough to encourage an</p>
<p>investigator, but not so large as to enervate him. there was only one reason which made ward mortimer s position a little difficult at the belmore street museum,</p>
<p>and that was the extreme eminence of the man whom he had to succeed. professor andreas was a profound scholar and a man of european reputation. his lectures</p>
<p>were frequented by students from every part of the world, and his admirable management of the collection intrusted to his care was a commonplace in all learned societies.</p>
<p>there was, therefore, considerable surprise when, at the age of fifty-five, he suddenly resigned his position and retired from those duties which had been both his livelihood and</p>
<p>his pleasure. he and his daughter left the comfortable suite of rooms which had formed his official residence in connection with the museum, and my friend, mortimer, who</p>
<p>was a bachelor, took up his quarters there. on hearing of mortimer s appointment professor andreas had written him a very kindly and flattering congratulatory letter. i was</p>
<p>actually present at their first meeting, and i went with mortimer round the museum when the professor showed us the admirable collection which he had cherished so long.</p>
<p>the professor s beautiful daughter and a young man, captain wilson, who was, as i understood, soon to be her husband, accompanied us in our inspection. there were</p>
<p>fifteen rooms, but the babylonian, the syrian, and the central hall, which contained the /ewish and egyptian collection, were the finest of all. professor andreas was a quiet,</p>
<p>dry, elderly man, with a clean-shaven face and an impassive manner, but his dark eyes sparkled and his features quickened into enthusiastic life as he pointed out to</p>
<p>us the rarity and the beauty of some of his specimens. his hand lingered so fondly over them, that one could read his pride in them and the</p>
<p>grief in his heart now that they "were passing" from his care into that of another. he had shown us in turn his mummies, his papyri, his rare</p>
<p>scarabs, his inscriptions, his iewish relics, and his duplication of the famous seven-branched candlestick of the temple, which was brought to rome by titus, and which is supposed</p>
<p>by some to be lying at this instant in the bed of the tiber, then he approached a case which stood in the Very centre of the hall,</p>
<p>and he looked down through the glass with reverence in his attitude and manner. "this is no novelty to an expert like yourself, mr. mortimer," said he; "but</p>
<p>i daresay that your friend, mr. iackson, will be interested to see it," leaning over the case i saw an object, some five inches square, which consisted of</p>
<p>twelve precious stones in a framework of gold, with golden hooks at two of the corners. the stones were all varying in sort and colour, but they were</p>
<p>of the same size. their shapes, arrangement, and gradation of tint made me think of a box of water-colour paints. each stone had some hieroglyphic scratched upon its</p>
<p>surface. "you have heard, mr. iackson, of the urim and thummim?" i had heard the term, but my idea of its meaning was exceedingly vague. "the urim and</p>
<p>thummim was a name given to the iewelled plate which lay upon the breast of the high priest of the iews. they had a very special feeling of</p>
<p>reverence for it--something of the feeling which an ancient roman might have for the sibylline books in the capitol. there are, as you see, twelve magnificent stones, inscribed</p>
<p>with mystical characters. counting from the left-hand top corner, the stones are carnelian, peridot, emerald, ruby, lapis lazuli, onyx, sapphire, agate, amethyst, topaz, beryl, and iasper." i was</p>
<p>amazed at the variety and beauty of the stones. "has the breastplate any particular history?" i asked. "it is of great age and of immense value," said professor</p>
<p>andreas, "without being able to make an absolute assertion, we have many reasons to think that it is possible that it may be the original urim and thummim</p>
<p>of solomon s temple. there is certainly nothing so fine in any collection in europe. my friend, captain wilson, here, is a practical authority upon precious stones, and</p>
<p>he would tell you how pure these are," captain wilson, a man with a dark, hard, incisive face, was standing beside his fiancee at the other side of</p>
<p>the case. "yes," said he, curtly, "i have never seen finer stones." "and the gold-work is also worthy of attention. the ancients excelled in----"--he was apparently about to</p>
<p>indicate the setting of the stones, when captain wilson interrupted him. "you will see a finer example of their gold-work in this candlestick," said he, turning to</p>
