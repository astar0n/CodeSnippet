<p>you recall our little argument, i gather?" "i certainly do, and it looks like she was right!" i sald with</p>
<p>a smile. harry neither laughed nor smiled. "yes, of course she was," he answered, then hastily and emphatically added, "in</p>
<p>her dreams!" i laughed. "and also in yours!" harry flashed a short, sardonic smile. "so where is this wife of</p>
<p>yours? why isn t she also here in this dream of mine?" "she hasn t been resurrected yet. but soon</p>
<p>she will be!" i answered cheerily. "of course, anything is possible in dreams!" "it sure is! and this is one</p>
<p>heck of a dream to live in," my father sald, keeping up the charade. dad then turned towards me. "hey,</p>
<p>son, since he liked your playing so much, how about giving him a number or two?" harry looked at me.</p>
<p>"yes, why not? i suppose you ll play as well in my dream as you did in real life." "better!"</p>
<p>i bragged. i therefore retrieved my guitar and footstool and sat myself on a chair in the middle of our</p>
<p>living room. "all right, harry, any requests?" for a moment he was silent, unsure of his choice. finally, he replied,</p>
<p>"beethoven s moonlight sonata." although written for the pianoforte, and thus technically not part of the guitar repertoire, nonetheless, francisco</p>
<p>tarrega had also arranged a guitar version for it. i had always loved both the piano and guitar versions, and</p>
<p>thus played it often at guitar recitals. i took a second or two to compose myself. then i commenced the</p>
<p>famous arpeggio introduction, slowly and somberly, letting the notes ripple forth their melancholic charm. then came its equally melancholic melody,</p>
<p>riding with and above the ongoing arpeggio. harry and my parents stared and listened intently to the music flowing gently</p>
<p>and seductively out of that magical musical box. occasionally, i glanced up at harry, delighted to see that he too</p>
<p>seemed to be enjoying it. finally, upon completion, my parents clapped, grinning with admiration. yet harry looked as mournful as</p>
<p>the music he had just heard. "yes, a fine performance. well done!" then with another ironic smile, he added, "perhaps</p>
<p>even segovia would have approved." "you know of andres segovia?" i asked, complemented by the praise. "yes. i have even</p>
<p>seen him perform live in concert, as i have a number of other great musicians, including the pianist, wilhelm kempff,</p>
<p>and the violinist, mischa elman." "by the sounds of it, you re a music connoisseur. did you also play an</p>
<p>instrument?" i asked. he gravely shook his head. "no, i knew i would never have the talent, nor in fact</p>
<p>the time." "but here you have!" i quickly added. "i can teach you. i also play the piano. it had</p>
<p>been, after all, my second instrument of choice for my master s degree in music. of course, i can t</p>
<p>play it nearly as well as the guitar. still, i can teach you either, or even both of these instruments.</p>
<p>would you like to learn?" harry sniggered. "what? learn to play a musical instrument whilst still being in a dream!"</p>
<p>i smiled almost mischievously at my next ploy. "but didn t you say anything is possible in dreams?" he nodded.</p>
<p>"yes, i did." "well, harry, because you believe anything is possible in dreams, what about you now playing the guitar?"</p>
<p>he hesitated for a moment and then accepted the challenge. "all right, i ll just focus on the belief that</p>
<p>i can play beethoven on the guitar. as roger had suggested to me, when i m in one of these</p>
<p>lucid dreams, i need to take control. he believed it was possible by visualizing something strongly enough, i might be</p>
<p>able to affect the outcome of the dream," he shrugged his shoulders, "all right, i might as well test his</p>
<p>hypothesis right now." he placed the guitar on his lap and clumsily placed his left fingers on the fretboard, and</p>
<p>the right hand over the strings near the sounding hole. then, almost theatrically, he closed his eyes and visualized himself</p>
<p>playing the guitar. he must have gone through the entire score, but finally he opened his eyes, and then with</p>
<p>an intent glare, he started to pluck the strings. however, instead of moonlight sonata we only heard some muffled and</p>
<p>uncoordinated notes. we all laughed heartily, except harry. he instantly stopped and angrily pushed the guitar back at me.</p>
<p>told you i couldn t play!" we all stifled our laughter. "i m sorry, harry, but you either just proved</p>
<p>the error of roger s hypothesis, or else we have finally proved to you that you re not dreaming." "you</p>
<p>ve done nothing of the kind! i just couldn t focus myself enough, that s all." i smiled and nodded.</p>
<p>"all right, harry, i won t try to convince you. just go ahead and continue dreaming. meanwhile, as long as</p>
<p>it lasts, can i show you around your very own dream?" it was Just then that cory started sniffing around</p>
<p>harry s legs. "does this dog have to come with us?" he asked, pushing cory aside. it was obvious that</p>
<p>harry was no animal lover, but i simply smiled and replied, "no, of course not." "good!" be snapped. "have you</p>
<p>any pens and writing material in this dreamworld?" puzzled, i asked, "yes, but why s that?" he stared at me</p>
<p>as if i was an imbecile. "i thought that would be obvious." he then heaved a sigh. "by writing the</p>
<p>dream down, i will then be able to recall the details better when i wake up in the morning. have</p>
<p>you already forgotten that i keep a iournal for my lucid dreams?" "no, of course not. i ll go get</p>
<p>them for you," moments later, i handed him a pencil and a clipboard with a stack of paper. thus prepared,</p>
<p>we commenced our tour of paradise. the first place my father and i showed him was the building site area</p>
<p>on the southern outskirts of our village. a group of our brethren were currently constructing a dozen or so</p>
<p>"i</p>
