<p>i told those ohure detectives everything i know. which isn t much by the way - say can i get</p>
<p>you something to drink, coffee or ice water or something like that - tiffany, have you offered mr. wright anything</p>
<p>yet?" the girl, tiffany, shook her head while henry took a breath on mrs. murphy s behalf; it was amazing</p>
<p>how this short petite woman could manage such a stream of words and activity without seeming to pause in-between for</p>
<p>a breath. "what would you like?" tiffany, the teenager at the desk smiled her silvery smile. "coffee, black, please." henry</p>
<p>smiled back at the girl, he felt as though he was going to need an infusion of caffeine to keep</p>
<p>up with mrs. murphy. "bring it in to the conference room tiffany" mrs. murphy said to the girl as she</p>
<p>turned on her heel and started walking rapidly, almost fogging towards the back of the office. "this way, mr. wright,"</p>
<p>she said over her shoulder as she turned down an aisle into the maze of cubicles. henry was amazed at</p>
<p>how someone that short, she had to be all of five feet tall, even with those high heels she was</p>
<p>wearing, could cover so much ground so quickly. henry took several quick large steps across the carpet to catch up</p>
<p>with her. she walked down several aisles in the maze of cubicles with desks built in and stacks of papers</p>
<p>and files on every desk. phones were ringing noisily and the office seemed to be a beehive of activity. he</p>
<p>caught up with mrs. murphy just as she disappeared through a conference room door. henry stepped into the conference room</p>
<p>and sat down into one of the large leather chairs that surrounded a huge cherry wood conference table. the room</p>
<p>was not real large," the table filled it and didn t leave much space to walk around, the beautiful table</p>
<p>and the big black chairs gave the room an elegant, plush feeling. the walls of the room were lined with</p>
<p>professional photographs of large estates in the palm springs area. the picture directly behind henry was bob hope s futuristic</p>
<p>looking space ship house that was perched on a hilltop not too far from the real estate office. mrs. murphy</p>
<p>noticed henry looking around and said, "the pictures are some of the homes and estates where our office has been</p>
<p>involved in the transaction." "oh, very impressive!" henry said, "i didn t realize the hope estate had been sold." mrs.</p>
<p>murphy looked a little uncomfortable at henry s question and said "well, it really hasn t, but we re hoping</p>
<p>that now that the great man is gone - god rest his soul - that the hope family will consider</p>
<p>our office when they decide what to do with the place - and i think it does make for a</p>
<p>neat addition to our picture wall doesn t it. oh, where is that tiffany with your drink - i d</p>
<p>better check on her." as mrs. murphy picked up the phone, there was a knock on the door and tiffany</p>
<p>opened it to place a large white ceramic mug with the coachella real estate logo on it filled with hot</p>
<p>black coffee on the table. "thank you dear, that s all." mrs. murphy said, as she waved her hand dismissing</p>
<p>the teenager and sentencing her back to the front desk with her phone, magazine and nail file. "now, mr. wright,</p>
<p>you are here to ask me about rex, mr. thornbird i mean, though i cannot possibly imagine what i can</p>
<p>tell you that isn t already in the report that the ohure detectives took, why they had a tape recorder</p>
<p>and everything, they were very interested in what i had to say - though i must say i don t</p>
<p>know a soul who would want to harm rrr, rrr, mr. thornbird. he s the best agent this office has</p>
<p>ever had, and the nicest man as well." henry picked up his coffee cup, took a slow sip of the</p>
<p>hot coffee and asked, "can i call you rosie, mrs. murphy?" "well of course mr. wright, everyone in the office</p>
<p>calls me rosie, my real name is rosalyn, but that is so old-fashioned don t you agree, rosie suits me</p>
<p>much better, that s why my hair is this color as well, this isn t my natural color you see,</p>
<p>there is a sweet old lady in a small shop on indian canyon that orders this color especially for me,</p>
<p>and i had her promise me not to use it on anyone else" she stopped the stream of words when</p>
<p>henry held his hand up to silence her for a moment. "please call me henry, and though i would really</p>
<p>like to hear about your hairdresser some ohure time, i d like to spend a few minutes with you talking</p>
<p>about mr. thornbird. please tell me how long you have known him and what your relationship with him was like</p>
<p>and also some of his past deals - especially what he was currently working on." henry was a little annoyed</p>
<p>as he caught himself doing the same thing as the woman sitting across the table from him by blurting out</p>
<p>all the questions he wanted to ask at once. he set his coffee cup down on the table a little</p>
<p>too hard and some of the coffee sloshed out onto the cherry table top, he took a deep breath to</p>
<p>get his control back as he reached into his pocket for his handkerchief to wipe the coffee up before it</p>
<p>penetrated the beautiful wood of the table. "rosie, let s take this slowly, ok?" he said folding his handkerchief back</p>
<p>up. "how long have you known mr. thornbird?" the small woman with the bright red hair was obviously startled when</p>
<p>henry put his coffee cup on the table and looked at him with her large bright green eyes and said</p>
<p>"i met mr. thornbird when i came to work here at the office as a receptionist four years ago."</p>
