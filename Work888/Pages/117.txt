<p>geese. the tanker flight chief took rick and don to the nco club for a late midnight meal while the</p>
<p>ut transit tanker ground crew refueled 3653 for them. you ll be going to kadena as soon as they finish</p>
<p>the refuel. you re our round robin flight for the day. you left guam, came here, will go to kadena</p>
<p>to stay. another tanker will go to guam from kadena this afternoon, then come here and back to kadena. you</p>
<p>ll probably fly a round robin about once or twice more while you re here. when the flight chief dropped</p>
<p>them off at their tanker the new flight crew had already arrived and was starting their preflight. as would happen</p>
<p>many times in the world of sac they were amongst friends. the flight crew was from fairchild and rick had</p>
<p>flown with them out of their home base. "where did you guys go. to sattahip for a short time</p>
<p>chief?" the pilot hollered from where he sat in his cockpit seat. "i ll be down in a second and</p>
<p>we can do our walk around." "okay captain. and no, we weren t in sattahip. they have drive up window</p>
<p>service here, sir. no need to go downtown at ut anymore. didn t the boomer clue you in to that?</p>
<p>he s been here before and should be up on the finer social convenient aspects of the sattahip bar girls."</p>
<p>"he s shaking his head no, rick. says to tell you that you re the same wise ass that was</p>
<p>at fairchild and payback is hell. i ll be down in a sec." when rick climbed abread 3653 after engine</p>
<p>start he realized that the cargo compartment was almost full of geese. looking aft through the cockpit door he waited</p>
<p>for the boom operator to enter the cockpit. "we have 86 passengers, rick, 8 mail bags stowed aft towards the</p>
<p>boom pod. and those two pallets just aft of the cargo door." "what are they boom?" "spare tanker parts for</p>
<p>kadena the manifest says. they came in on a c14I earlier. i guess the 141 forgot to stop at kadena</p>
<p>so we ended up taking them." "you managed to end up here at kadena instead of ut. how did you</p>
<p>manage that?" were the first words out of msgt. bob kruse s mouth when rick stepped onto the tarmac at</p>
<p>kadena afb. "actually i had pull from some of kadena s ncos." the two friends gave each other a quick</p>
<p>hug. "this is don naylor, my new right hand man and back up. i found him wandering around the flightline</p>
<p>at fairchild so i kidnapped him." rick introduced his new assistant to kruse. "don, if you have any problems getting</p>
<p>along with sgt. davis let me know. i know all of his secrets and hang ups." without any further comment,</p>
<p>kruse picked up an awol bag and parachute bag from the pile of gear the two crew chiefs had taken</p>
<p>off their tanker, and started for his truck. "come on. i ll take you to the transit barracks. since you</p>
<p>ll be here for at least 14 days tdy, you don t get to spend it in the luxury of</p>
<p>the vboq." "what happened after we left that gave us a chance at such a short tdy here, bob? "somebody</p>
<p>in plans and scheduling screwed up to put it bluntly. they had 3653, listed as a young tiger on a</p>
<p>I20 day tdy. when as we know, you were only here on hold for the f4s coming out of thailand.</p>
<p>so they ended up being a tanker short. they couldn t get an additional tanker for the full I20 days</p>
<p>until after 1 september, but 3653 was available until the 3rd or 4th of september. so here you are." after</p>
<p>they pulled up in front of the transit barracks kruse picked up a manilla folder from the pickup s seat.</p>
<p>opened it and carefully keeping the contents from rick s view, extracted several sheets of mimeographed papers. "thought that you</p>
<p>might be interested in this message from fairchild that came for you yesterday." he handed rick the stapled together sheets</p>
<p>with a big smile. rick skimmed the contents of the top sheet. "holy shit! are these for real, bob?" "congratulations</p>
<p>staff sergeant. not bad, staff in Just over four years." "so when are we on the schedule, bob?" rick asked</p>
<p>as msgt, kruse was starting down the barracks stairs after helping the crew chiefs carry flight gear to their room,</p>
<p>"monday, the 2Ist. be your first combat mission. you ll be flying a combat apple patrol mission off of the</p>
<p>coast of vietnam. so en/"oy your day off tomorrow and meet me in the nco club for dinner after you</p>
<p>come back from naha. about 1I30 hours or so." "who said anything about naha?" "i just think that it s</p>
<p>a given. you seem to have been drawn in that direction on your last trip to the island." don naylor</p>
<p>had passed on the opportunity of going to naha with rick. he had met up with a couple of people</p>
<p>he had known before. the male of the pair had a car, an old II52 olds, but nonetheless transportation. the</p>
<p>three of them were going to spend the day exploring the island s beaches. so rick was on his own.</p>
<p>after a leisurely brunch at the nco club, rick had grabbed a pink sukoshi cab at the highway #1 gate</p>
<p>and soon found himself window shopping on kokusai dori. he had wandered up one side of the street and down</p>
<p>the other wandering through several small stores and the huge ryubo department store. he ended up buying two more short</p>
<p>sleeved shirts with hawaiian-like floral patterns he had seen many okinawan men wearing and a set of panasonic headphones for</p>
<p>his stereo. he had a small apartment in medical lake, a small town outside of fairchild afb, and often worried</p>
<p>that his stereo was too loud and would bother his neighbors. rick hesitated on the sidewalk before realizing that</p>
<p>I</p>
