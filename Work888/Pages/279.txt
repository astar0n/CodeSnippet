<p>so they cruise along at the legal speed of I0 mph. the lookout truck and the ramp truck are both</p>
<p>dead heading home thus empty and faster. they soon catch up with ed and iim. they follow a few hundred</p>
<p>yards behind, relaying the mile marker locations to their friends further ahead. ed and iim soon catch up. the caravan</p>
<p>of trucks now paces their prey. this odd caravan rolls across the western nebraskan night for about an hour. just</p>
<p>east of north platte, the beers ed and iim drank earlier find their way to their bladders and /im says,</p>
<p>"hey, how about that rest stop ahead?" their suv pulls into the deserted rest stop. "there they go!" flashes from</p>
<p>cb aerial to aerial. ed parks the suv. they hop out and enter the small deserted building. their escort of</p>
<p>trucks just behind flashes turn signals. five pull into the truck parking area across from the small brick building. two</p>
<p>of the trucks stop on the entrance ramp thus blocking it, while /"im and ed are in the men s</p>
<p>room, six drivers scurry across the frozen parking lot and silently position themselves outside the restroom door. when they hear</p>
<p>blow dryers, they nod and ready themselves. first iim walks out and is grabbed by three of the truckers. one</p>
<p>quickly duct tapes his mouth shut while one clamps his arm firmly around /"im s neck whispering, "relax kid. keep</p>
<p>squirming and i ll break this skinny little neck of yours." the third trucker quickly binds iim s hands behind</p>
<p>him with more duct tape and then all three quietly drag him out into the dimly lit parking area. unawares,</p>
<p>ed now exits the men s room and is likewise bound and gagged. both iim and ed are dumped into</p>
<p>the trailer of one of the empty trucks, the one whose drivers recognized them. one of the drivers looks into</p>
<p>the trailer before he slams and latches the door and says, "you fuckers killed some friends of mine the ohure</p>
<p>day back on i25I just so you know. you took some shots at me and my partner too. now we</p>
<p>re gonna even the score, say your prayers, guys, this night s gonna be your last." he slams the tall</p>
<p>metal door with a clang. they hear the latches, attached to a rod the length of the door, slide into</p>
<p>place. outside they hear the crunch of the driver s boots on the snow as he walks to the tractor.</p>
<p>the tractor door slams and the air brakes wheeze. the big diesel roars and the truck lurches forward. the ohure</p>
<p>trucks have begun to roll uvest too. there s some comments on the cb s but mainly it s a</p>
<p>silent convoy heading into the empty spaces of western nebraska and eastern wyoming. at the i80/iII split, all but one</p>
<p>truck head south on :II towards denver. the lone truck remaining goes west onto the deserted stretch of i80 towards</p>
<p>cheyenne. iim and ed writhe in its ohurewise empty trailer. ed and /"im manage to squirm around until, with their</p>
<p>free fingers, they manage rip the duct tape off their mouths leaving their faces scared with bloody, red welts which,</p>
<p>in the darkness, they do not see but certainly feel. iim says to ed, "man, i m scared. where the</p>
<p>hell are they taking us?" "out in the middle of nowhere and then shoot us, i guess." "can you try</p>
<p>to pull the duct tape off my hands." they wrapped it around about ten times and i can barely {Hi</p>
<p>my fingers in this cold." after some more squirming and rolling about ed say, "no way. i can t find</p>
<p>a start to it and there s too many loops to rip. try mine." after a while iim says, "it</p>
<p>s no use, there s nothing i can do. at least let s pull together, it must be fucking -30/</p>
<p>in here." they huddle together in silence trying to conserve body heat knowing that it probably won t matter much</p>
<p>longer. /ust inside wyoming, the truck pulls off the interstate onto an old state route heading north. the outline yellow</p>
<p>trailer lights are cut and just the headlights and small red tail lights are visible. finally, miles from the interstate</p>
<p>and many miles from any settlement, the truck stops, moonlight bathes the snow covered rolling high prairie. a few small,</p>
<p>dark clumps of trees can be seen here and there in the distance. the drivers get out and open the</p>
<p>rear of their trailer. iim and ed are huddled next to each ohure in the sub zero cold. as one</p>
<p>driver climbs up into the trailer, dim lights on the trailer roof switch on. he grabs ed and iim by</p>
<p>their coat collars and drags them towards the rear opening. his partner is waiting on the ground with a hand</p>
<p>gun pointed at them. the guy on the truck takes out a knife and slits the duct tape binding their</p>
<p>arms and legs then slips it back into its sheath attached to his wide leather belt. he hops down and</p>
<p>his partner pulls anohure hand gun from his belt and hands it to him. they both stand back and one</p>
<p>says, "okay you two, out of the trailer." they iump to the ground. ed stumbles and lands on his hands</p>
<p>on the cold icy road surface, cutting his palms in several places. he quickly stands up, folding his arms and</p>
<p>placing his hands under his armpits. /"im starts whimpering, the driver slams and bolts the door, one of the drivers</p>
<p>laughs and turns to his partner and says, "they re not as tough without a gun in their hands shooting</p>
<p>the tires out from under a 56 year old guy with a wife and three kids, are they?" "guess not.</p>
<p>i guess not." iim says, "you can t do this, it s cold blooded murder. you ll hang for this.</p>
<p>you won t get away with it." one trucker laughs and says to the ohure, "ya know, he has</p>
