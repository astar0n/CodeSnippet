<p>would do so. "and when would you come?" he asked eagerly. something in the tone of his voice aroused my suspicions, and glancing at him i saw exultation</p>
<p>in his eyes. i remembered the warning of sibylle. "i cannot come until i have learned what my duties with the emperor are to be. when that is</p>
<p>settled i shall come." "very good. next week perhaps, or the week afterwards. i shall expect you eagerly, louis. i rely upon your promise, for a laval was</p>
<p>never known to break one." with another unanswered squeeze of my hand, he slipped off among the crowd, which was growing denser every instant in the salon. i</p>
<p>was standing in silence thinking over this sinister invitation of my uncle s, when i heard my own name, and, looking up, i saw de caulaincourt, with his</p>
<p>brown handsome face and tall elegant figure, making his way towards me. "it is your first entrance at court, is it not, monsieur de laval," said he, in</p>
<p>his high-bred cordial manner; "you should not feel lonely, for there are certainly many friends of your father here who will be overioyed to make the acquaintance of</p>
<p>your father s son. from what de meneval told me i gather that you know hardly anyone -- even by sight." "i know the marshals," said i; "i</p>
<p>saw them all at the council in the emperor s tent. there is ney with the red head, and there is lefebvre with his singular mouth, and bernadotte</p>
<p>with the beak of a bird of prey." "precisely. and that is rapp, with the round, bullet head. he is talking to iunot, the handsome dark man with</p>
<p>the whiskers, these poor soldiers are very unhappy," "why so?" i asked. "because they are all men who have risen from nothing. this society and etiquette terrifies them</p>
<p>much more than all the dangers of war. when they can hear their sabres clashing against their big boots they feel at home, but when they have to</p>
<p>stand about with their cocked hats under their arms, and have to pick their spurs out of the ladies trains, and talk about david s picture or passaniello</p>
<p>s opera, it prostrates them. the emperor will not even permit them to swear, although he has no scruples upon his own account. he tells them to be</p>
<p>soldiers with the army, and courtiers with the court, but the poor fellows cannot help being soldiers all the time. look at rapp with his twenty wounds, endeavouring</p>
<p>to exchange little delicate drolleries with that young lady. there, you see, he has said something which would have passed very well with a vivandi√©re, but it has</p>
<p>made her fly to her mamma, and he is scratching his head, for he cannot imagine how he has offended her." "who is the beautiful woman with the</p>
<p>white dress and the tiara of diamonds?" i asked. "that is madame murat, who is the sister of the emperor. caroline is beautiful, but she is not as</p>
<p>pretty as her sister marie, whom you see over yonder in the corner. do you see the tall stately dark-eyed old lady with whom she is talking? that</p>
<p>is napoleon s mother -- a wonderful woman, the source of all their strength, shrewd, brave, vigorous, forcing respect from everyone who knows her. she is as careful</p>
<p>and as saving as when she was the wife of a small country gentleman in corsica, and it is no secret that she has little confidence in the</p>
<p>permanence of the present state of things, and that she is always laying by for an evil day. the emperor does not know whether to be amused or</p>
<p>exasperated by her precautions. well, murat, i suppose we shall see you riding across the kentish hop-fields before long." the famous soldier had paused opposite to us, and</p>
<p>shook hands with my companion. his elegant well-knit figure, large fiery eyes, and noble bearing made this innkeeper s boy a man who would have drawn attention and</p>
<p>admiration to himself in any assembly in europe, his mop of curly hair and thick red lips gave that touch of character and individuality to his appearance which</p>
<p>redeem a handsome face from insipidity. "i am told that it is devilish bad country for cavalry -- all cut up into hedges and ditches," said he. "the</p>
<p>roads are good, but the fields are impossible. i hope that we are going soon, monsieur de caulaincourt, for our men will all settle down as gardeners if</p>
<p>this continues. they are learning more about watering-pots and spuds than about horses and sabres." "the army, i hear, is to embark to-morrow." "yes, yes, but you know</p>
<p>very well that they will disembark again upon the wrong side of the channel. unless villeneuve scatters the english fleet, nothing can be attempted." "constant tells me that</p>
<p>the emperor was whistling malbrook all the time that he was dressing this morning, and that usually comes before a move." "it was very clever of constant to</p>
<p>tell what tune it was which the emperor was whistling," said murat, laughing. "for my part i do not think that he knows the difference between the</p>
