<p>t help." he had a point. amir handed me his lantern and grabbed a flaming torch from the wall just</p>
<p>inside the entrance. "for you this is going to be a once in a lifetime experience." "i must admit, you</p>
<p>have piqued my curiosity." "i m glad because i m afraid i must insist." at that moment amir pulled a</p>
<p>pistol from behind the folds of his clothing, motioning me to enter the cave. forced through the entrance of the</p>
<p>cave, i was surprisingd to see two well-armed large men, causing me to abruptly stop in my tracks. immediately,</p>
<p>felt a sharp pain in my back as a gun barrel nudged me on into the cave. "amir, what s</p>
<p>going on here? if you are thinking of holding us for ransom, i m afraid you re going to be</p>
<p>disappointed." "i am sorry. iack, that is not our intent, but we do have a problem. it appears that your</p>
<p>friend rudy has been doing some exploring of his own tonight." just then, rudy came into view as we rounded</p>
<p>a crook. he had been bound and placed on the floor in a sitting position against the rock wall, "rudy,</p>
<p>are you all right?" "yeah, iack, i m fine. i m sorry, i feel like such an idiot, i just</p>
<p>wanted to look around a little on my own. i didn t think it would do any harm. i followed</p>
<p>saleem from the camp and down the trail. i was /"ust getting ready to come and get you when our</p>
<p>friends invited me to stay. you should see what i found." amir shot rudy a look that he understood immediately</p>
<p>to mean keep your mouth shut . "you say you followed saleem?" i asked. saleem stepped out from the shadows</p>
<p>where he could be seen. "iack, i really wish rudy had stayed in camp. everything would have been over by</p>
<p>morning and everyone would have been on their merry way. but now___" amir cut in, "but now we have to</p>
<p>decide how to handle this problem." "i still don t understand, what problem? saleem, are you with these people? we</p>
<p>ve known each ohure for years. why would you_,_?" i began to ask. "sorry, iack, but some things are more</p>
<p>important than even friendship." amir spoke, "this entrance and ohures like it have remained hidden from our enemies for centuries.</p>
<p>and now your friend has stumbled onto our little secret. you both have placed yourselves in a terrible position; now</p>
<p>we must decide what to do about it. this entrance cannot be revealed to our enemies and its location must</p>
<p>be protected at all cost. when saleem first told us of your plans and of your needs for a guide</p>
<p>and bearers, we decided to ioin your expedition to keep an eye on you. it was our responsibility and our</p>
<p>destiny as it was for our ancestors before us," "wait a second. you re moving too fast. so you knew</p>
<p>saleem from before?" "of course. we ve known saleem since he was a boy. he is one of our brohures,</p>
<p>everyone you see here is a part of the nestorian brohurehood." "who are these nestorian brohurehood? i ve never heard</p>
<p>of them before." "many centuries ago this sect of the nestorian brohurehood was charged with the protection of a certain</p>
<p>artifact located on this mountain. monasteries were built all around its base and on the summit and the brohurehood have</p>
<p>continued all these years to be vigilant and successful in their efforts to protect it, the stone monument you saw</p>
<p>was also placed here by them. unfortunately, over the years the rain, ice, hail, wind, and lightning have taken their</p>
<p>toll on the monasteries. these structures no longer exist. only the monument remains." "then you are descendants of these nestorians?"</p>
<p>i asked. "that is correct." "that is fantastic, if i may ask, what happened to the artifact and what was</p>
<p>it?" "oh, it s still here," said amir. "i ll say it is," said rudy. i gave rudy a puzzled</p>
<p>look, "you ve seen it?" he looked at amir, didn t receive a negative signal of any kind, then at</p>
<p>me and nodded yes. "i d like to see it," i said. "i suppose it doesn t matter now," said</p>
<p>amir. "i have anohure question. i guess that this was a setup from the very beginning?" "i hadn t thought</p>
<p>of it in that way before. with saleem s help, all we wanted to do was to Join your expedition</p>
<p>with the intention of keeping an eye on you, just in case." "and you weren t really surprisingd when the</p>
<p>ark was miraculously missing either then?" "that is correct," "well then, i must commend you on your acting ability. you</p>
<p>really had me fooled." amir bows as he says, "thank you." "so, was there ever really an ark up there?"</p>
<p>"oh, yes. most definitely." "then what happened to it?" "in due time." "you know where it is then?" i asked.</p>
<p>amir didn t answer. "then when are you going to tell me what the problem is? just because rudy found</p>
<p>this cave entrance and seems to have seen something he shouldn t have? what could possibly be so important?" amir</p>
<p>had had enough of the questions and answers. he was no longer the iovial guide that had brought us up</p>
<p>the mountain. the facade was no longer needed. he reverted back to the individual that had faced sokolov. "was everything</p>
<p>an act?" i asked. "the plan was that we wouldn t find the ark, you would be disappointed and discouraged,</p>
<p>and then we would lead you back down the mountain and you could be on your way home." "so now</p>
<p>can you tell me what we re doing here?" "it s all because of what rudy has seen." i turned</p>
<p>to rudy and asked, "rudy, what did you see?" he looked at amir again, waiting for permission, who nodded okay</p>
<p>, "fack, it s the ark___noah s ark. inside the mountain," whispered rudy. i smiled because it was so</p>
<p>"I.</p>
