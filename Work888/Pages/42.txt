<p>this morning without seeing me." his look was very intent, almost as if he were searching for something; but it</p>
<p>did not disconcert her as she had half-expected to be disconcerted. his eyes were more caressing than dominant /"ust then.</p>
<p>"what if i didn t see you because i didn t dare?" he sald. that gave her confidence. "i should</p>
<p>think you couldn t be so silly as that," she sald with decision. he smiled a little. "thank you, miladi.</p>
<p>then wasn t it--almost equally silly--your word, not mine!--of you to be afraid of me last night?" she felt the</p>
<p>thrust in a moment, and went white, conscious of the weak sick feeling that so often came over her at</p>
<p>the sound of her mother s step when she was in disgrace. he saw her distress, but he allowed several</p>
<p>moments to elapse before he came to the rescue; then lightly, "pray don t let the matter disturb you!" he</p>
<p>sald. "only--for your peace of mind--let me tell you that you really have nothing to fear. out here we live</p>
<p>in fairyland, and no one is in earnest. we just enjoy ourselves, and mrs. grundy simply doesn t exist. we</p>
<p>are not ashamed of being frivolous, and we do whatever we like. and there are no consequences. always remember that,</p>
<p>miss bathurst! there are never any consequences in fairyland." his eyes suddenly laughed at her, and dinah was vastly reassured.</p>
<p>her dismay vanished, leaving a blithe sense of irresponsibility in its place. "i shall remember that," she sald, with her</p>
<p>gay little nod. "i dreamt last night that we were in olympus." "we?" he sald softly. she nodded again, flushed</p>
<p>and laughing, confident that she had received her cue. "and you--were apollo." she saw his eyes change magically, flashing into</p>
<p>swift life, and dropped her own before the mastery that dawned there. "and you," he questioned under his breath, "were</p>
<p>daphne?" "perhaps," she sald enigmatically. after all, flirting was not such a difficult art, and since he had declared that</p>
<p>there could be no consequences, she did not see why she should bury this new-found talent of hers. "what a</p>
<p>charming dream!" he commented lazily. "but you know what happened to daphne when she ran away, don t you?" she</p>
<p>flung him a laughing challenge. "he didn t catch her anyway." "true!" smiled sir eustace. "but have you never wondered</p>
<p>whether it wouldn t have been more sport for her if he had? it wouldn t be very exciting, you</p>
<p>know, to lead the life of a vegetable." "it isn t!" declared dinah, with abrupt sincerity. "oh, you know something</p>
<p>about it, do you?" he sald. "then the modern daphne ought to have too much sense to run away." she</p>
<p>laughed with a touch of wistfulness, "i wonder how she felt about it afterwards." "i wonder," he agreed, tipping the</p>
<p>ash off his cigarette. "it didn t matter so much to apollo, you see. he had plenty to choose from."</p>
<p>dinah s wistfulness vanished in a swift breath of indignation. "really!" she sald. he looked at her. "yes, really," he</p>
<p>told her, with deliberation. "and he didn t need to run after them either. but, possibly," his gaze softened again,</p>
<p>"possibly that was what made him want daphne the most. elusiveness is quite a fascinating quality if it isn t</p>
<p>carried too far. still--" he smiled--"i expect he got over it in the end, you know; but in her case</p>
<p>i am not quite so sure." "i don t suppose he did get ever it," maintained dinah with spirit. "all</p>
<p>the rest must have seemed very cheap afterwards." "perhaps he was more at home with the cheap variety," he suggested</p>
<p>carelessly, his eyes had wandered to the buzzing throng behind her, and she saw a glint of criticism--or was it</p>
<p>merely easy contempt?--dispel the smile with which he had regarded her. his mouth wore a faint but unmistakable sneer. but</p>
<p>in a moment his look returned to her, kindled upon her. "are you for the ice carnival to-night?" he asked.</p>
<p>she drew a quick, eager breath. "oh, i do want to come! but i don t know--yet--if i shall be</p>
<p>allowed." "why ask?" he questioned. she hesitated, then ingenuously she told him her difficulty. "i got into trouble last night</p>
<p>for dancing so late with you. and--and--i may be sent to bed early to make up for it." he frowned.</p>
<p>"do you mean to say you d go?" she coloured vividly. "i in only nineteen, and i have to do</p>
<p>as i m told." "heavens above!" he sald. "you belong to the generation before the last evidently. no girl ever</p>
<p>does as she is told now-a-days. it isn t the thing." "i do," whispered dinah, in dire confusion, "at least--generally."</p>
<p>"and what happens if you don t?" he queried. "do they whip you and put you to bed?" she clenched</p>
<p>her hands hard. "don t!" she sald. "you re only ioking, i know. but--i hate it!" his manner changed in</p>
<p>a moment, became half-quizzical, half-caressing. "poor little brown elf, what a shame! well, come if you can! i shall look</p>
<p>out for you. i may have something to show you." "may you? oh, what?" cried dinah, all eagerness in a</p>
<p>moment. he laughed. there was a provoking hint of mystery in his manner, "ah! that lies in the future, miladi,"</p>
<p>"but tell me!" she persisted. "will You come then?" he asked. "perhaps," she sald. "if i can!" "ah! and perhaps</p>
<p>not!" he sald, "what then?" dinah s mouth grew suddenly firm. "i will come," she sald. "you will?" his keen</p>
<p>eyes held hers with smiling compulsion. "yes, i will." he made a gesture as if he would take her hand,</p>
<p>but restrained himself, and paused to tip the ash once more off his cigarette, "now tell me!" commanded dinah, "i</p>
<p>don t think i will," he sald deliberately. "but you must!" sald dinah. his eyes sought hers again with that</p>
<p>look which she found it impossible to meet. she bent over her cup. "what will you show me?" she</p>
