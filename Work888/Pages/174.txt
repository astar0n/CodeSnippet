<p>cares not that holy Piety should be his, nor takes the counsel with Good Thought, 0 Mazda, 3 And in</p>
<p>this belief {of ours}, 0 Mazda, Right is laid down, for blessing, in the heresy the Lie, for ruin. Therefore</p>
<p>I strive for the fellowship of Good Thought, I forbid all intercourse with the Liar. 4 They who make the</p>
<p>increase of violence and cruelty with their tongues, the foes of cattle-nurture among its friends; whose ill deeds prevail, not</p>
<p>their good deeds: these (shall be) in the house of the Daevas, {the place for) the Self of the Liar.</p>
<p>5 But he, 0 Mazda, - happiness and satiety be his who links his own Self with Good Thought, being</p>
<p>through Right an intimate of Piety. And with all these (may I be) in Thy Dominion, Ahura. 6 I beseech</p>
<p>you twain, 0 Mazda and the Right, to say what are the Plans of your will, that we may discern</p>
<p>how we might teach the Religion of such as you, O Ahura. I And this let Good Thought hear, 0</p>
<p>Mazda, let the Right hear, do thou also listen, 0 Ahura, which men of the brotherhood, what noble is it</p>
<p>according to the Law who brings to the community fame. 8 On Frashaoshtra do thou bestow the most gladsome fellowship</p>
<p>with the Right - this I ask thee, 0 Mazda Ahura - and on myself the hold on what is</p>
<p>good in thy Dominion. To all eternity we would be thy messengers. I Let the helper hear the ordinance, he</p>
<p>that is created to bring deliverance. The man of right words is no regarder of fellowship with the Liar, if</p>
<p>they that are partake:-5 of Right are to make their Selves partake in the best reward at the ﬂudgment, O</p>
<p>Famaspa. I8 .I YASNA 4I. 10 And this, 0 Mazda, will I put in thy care within thy House -</p>
<p>the Good Thought and the souls of the Righteous, their worship, their Piety and zeal, that thou mayst guard it,</p>
<p>0 thou mighty Dominion, with abiding power. 11 But these that are of an evil dominion, of evil deeds, evil</p>
<p>words, evil Self, and evil thought, Liars, the Souls go to meet them with evil food; in the House of</p>
<p>the Lie they shall be meet inhabitants. 12 what help hast thou, 0 Right, for Zarathushtra that calls upon me?</p>
<p>what hast thou, Good Thought? -- for me who with praises seeks your favor, 0 Mazda Ahura, longing for that</p>
<p>which is best in your possession. -- Yasna 4I -- .I YASNA 50, 1 Zarathushtra: (an my soul count on</p>
<p>any one for help? who is there found for my herd, who for myself a protector, indeed, at my call</p>
<p>other than the Right and thyself. 0 Mazda Ahura, and the 8est Thought." 2 How, 0 Mazda, should one desire</p>
<p>the luck-bringing cattle, one who would fain it would come to him with the pasture."(Mazda:} They that live uprightly according</p>
<p>to the Right among the many that look upon the sun, those whom they stand in iudgment, I will settle</p>
<p>in the dwellings of the wise. 3 izarathushtrai} So this (reward) shall come to him through the Right, 0 Mazda,</p>
<p>(this reward) which by the Dominion and Good Thought he promised, whomsoever by the power of his Destiny prospers the</p>
<p>neighboring possession that now the Liar holds. 4 I will worship you with praise, 0 Mazda Ahura, ioined with Right</p>
<p>and Best Thought and Dominion, that they, desired of pious men, may stand as ﬂudges on the path of the</p>
<p>obedient unto the House of Song. 5 Assured by you, 0 Mazda Ahura and Right, are the pointings of the</p>
<p>hand - since you are well-disposed to your prophet - which shall bring us to bliss, together with visible manifest</p>
<p>help. 6 The prophet Zarathushtra, 0 Mazda, who lifts up his voice in worship, as friend of Asha - may</p>
<p>the Creator of wisdom teach me his ordinances through Good Thought, that my tongue may have a pathway, I For</p>
<p>you I will harness the swiftest steeds, stout and strong, by the promptings of your praise, that ye may come</p>
<p>hither, 0 Mazda, Right, and Good thought. 8 Ever with verses that are recognized as those of pious zeal I</p>
<p>will come before you with outstretched hands, 0 Mazda, before you, O thou Right, with worship of the faithful man,</p>
<p>before you with all the capacity of Good Thought. I with those prayers I would come and praise you, 0</p>
<p>Mazda and thou Right, with actions of Good Thought. If I be master of my own destiny as I will,</p>
<p>then will I take thought for the portion of the wise in the same. 100 ? YASNA 50. 10 Those</p>
<p>actions that I shall achieve and those done aforetime, and those, 0 Good Thought, that are precious in thy sight,</p>
<p>the rays of the sun, the shimmering uprisings of the days, all is for your praise, O thou Right and</p>
<p>Mazda Ahura. 11 Your praiser, Mazda, will I declare myself and be, so long, 0 Right, as I have strength</p>
<p>and power. May the Creator of the world accomplish through Good Thought its fulfillment of all that most perfectly answers</p>
<p>to his will. -- Yasna 50 -- .I YASNA 51. 1 The good, the precious Dominion, as a most surpassing</p>
<p>portion, shall Right achieve for him that with zeal accomplishes what is best through his actions, 0 Mazda. This will</p>
<p>I now work out for us. 2 Before all, 0 Mazda Ahura, assure me the Dominion of your possession, 0</p>
<p>Right, and what is thine, 0 Piety. Your {Dominion} of blessing give through Good Thought to him that prays. 3</p>
<p>Let your ears attend to those who in their deeds and utterances hold to your words, Ahura and Right, to</p>
<p>those of Good Thought, for whom thou, Mazda, art the first teacher. 4 where is the recompense for wrong to</p>
<p>be found, where pardon for the same? where shall they attain the Right? where is the holy Piety, where Best</p>
<p>Thought? Thy Dominions, where are they, 0 Mazda? 5 All this (I) ask, whether the husbandman shall find cattle in</p>
<p>accordance with Right, he that is perfect in action, a man of understanding, when he prays to him, who hath</p>
<p>promised unto the wise the true ﬂudge, in that he is Lord of the two destinies... 6 Even he, Ahura</p>
<p>Mazda, who through his Dominion appoints what is better than good to him that is attached to his will, but</p>
<p>what is worse than evil to him that obeys him not, at the last end of life. I Give</p>
