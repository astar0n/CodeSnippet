<p>in other questions, and had simply forgotten the 8oard of</p>
<p>Irrigation. "it went of itself, like all such boards, by</p>
<p>the mere force of inertia. (Many people gained their livelihood</p>
<p>by the Board of Ir;-igation, especially one highly conscientious and</p>
<p>musical family: all the daughters played on stringed instruments, and</p>
<p>Alexey Alexandrovitch knew the family and had stood godfather to</p>
<p>one of the elder daughters.) The raising of this question</p>
<p>by a hostile department was in Alexey Alexandrovitch s opinion</p>
<p>a dishonorable proceeding, seeing that in every department there were</p>
<p>things similar and worse, which no one inquired into, for</p>
<p>Well-known reasons of official etiquette. However, now that the glove</p>
<p>had been thrown down to him, he had boldly picked</p>
<p>it up and demanded the appointment of a special commission</p>
<p>to investigate and verify the working of the Board of</p>
<p>I:-rigation of the lands in the Zaraisky province. But in</p>
<p>compensation he gave no quarter to the enemy either. He</p>
<p>demanded the appointment of another special commission to inquire into</p>
<p>the question of the Native Tribes Organization Committee. The question</p>
<p>of the Native Tribes had been 624 of 1I5I Anna</p>
<p>Karenina brought up incidentally in the Commission of the 2nd</p>
<p>of ﬂune, and had been pressed forward actively by Alexey</p>
<p>Alexandrovitch as one admitting of no delay on account of</p>
<p>the deplorable condition bf the native tribes, In the commission</p>
<p>this question had been a ground of contention between several</p>
<p>departments. The department hostile to Alexey Alexandrovitch proved that the</p>
<p>condition of the native tribes was exceedingly flourishing, that the</p>
<p>proposed reconstruction might be the ruin of their prosperity, and</p>
<p>that if there were anything wrong, it arose mainly from</p>
<p>the failure on the part of Alexey Alexandrovitch s department</p>
<p>to carry out the measures prescribed by law. Now Alexey</p>
<p>Alexandrovitch intended to demand: First, that a new commission should</p>
<p>be formed which should be empowered to investigate the condition</p>
<p>of the native tribes on the spot: secondly, if it</p>
<p>should appear that the condition of the native tribes actually</p>
<p>was such as it appeared to be from the official</p>
<p>documents in the hands of the committee, that another new</p>
<p>scientific commission should be appointed to investigate the deplorable condition</p>
<p>of the native tribes from the-(1) political, (2) administrative, {3}</p>
<p>economic, {4} ethnographical, (5) material, and {6} religious points of</p>
<p>view; thirdly, that evidence should be required from the 625</p>
<p>of 1I5I Anna Karenina rival department of the measures that</p>
<p>had been taken during the last ten years by that</p>
<p>department for averting the disastrous conditions in which the native</p>
<p>tribes were now placed; and fourthly and finally, that that</p>
<p>department explain why it had, as appeared from the evidence</p>
<p>before the committee, from No. 1I,015 and I8,038, from December</p>
<p>5, I863, and ﬂune I, I864, acted in direct contravention</p>
<p>of the intent of the law T...Act 18, and the</p>
<p>note to Act 36. A flash of eagerness suffused the</p>
<p>face of Alexey Alexandrovitch as he rapidly wrote out a</p>
<p>synopsis of these ideas for his own benefit. Having filled</p>
<p>a sheet of paper, he got up, rang, and sent</p>
<p>a note to the chief secretary of his department to</p>
<p>look up certain necessary facts for him. Getting up and</p>
<p>walking about the room, he glanced again at the portrait,</p>
<p>frowned, and smiled contemptuously. After reading a little more</p>
