<p>1.I I will scatter them as with an east wind before the enemy ; I will show them the back,</p>
<p>and not the face, in the day of their calamity. The People s Plots and ﬁeremiah s Prayer Then said</p>
<p>they, Come, and let us devise devices against tleremiah ," for the law shall not perish from the priest, nor</p>
<p>counsel from the wise, nor the word from the prophet. dome, and let us smite him with the tongue, and</p>
<p>let us not give heed to any of his words. Give heed to me, O Lord, and hearken to the</p>
<p>voice of them that contend with me. Shall evil be recompensed for good ? for they have digged a pit</p>
<p>for my soul. Remember that I stood before thee to speak good for them, and to turn away thy wrath</p>
<p>from them. Therefore deliver up their children to the famine, and pour out their blood by the force of the</p>
<p>sword ; and let their wives be bereaved of their children, and be widows ." and let their men be</p>
<p>put to death ; let their young men be slain by the sword in battle. Let a cry be heard</p>
<p>from their houses, when thou shalt bring a troop suddenly upon them : for they have digged a pit to</p>
<p>take me, and hid snares for my feet. Yet, Lord, thou knowest all their counsel against me to slay me</p>
<p>: forgive not their iniquity, neither blot out their sin from thy sight, but let them be overthrown before thee</p>
<p>I deal thus with them in the time of thine anger. 1I The Lesson from the Broken Vessel Thus saith</p>
<p>the Lord, Go and get a potter s earthen bottle, and take of the ancients of the people, and of</p>
<p>the ancients of the priests ; and go forth unto the valley of the son of Hinnom, which is by</p>
<p>the entry of the east gate, and proclaim there the words that I shall tell thee : II 18 1I</p>
<p>20 21 22 23 1 2 1653 ﬂeremiah 1I and say, Hear ye the word of the Lord, 0 kings</p>
<p>of Iudah, and inhabitants of ﬂerusalem ; Thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel ." Behold, I</p>
<p>will bring evil upon this place, the which whosoever heareth, his ears shall tingle. Because they have forsaken me, and</p>
<p>have estranged this place, and have burned incense in it unto other gods, whom neither they nor their fathers have</p>
<p>known, nor the kings of Fudah, and have filled this place with the blood of innocents ; they have built</p>
<p>also the high places of Baal, to burn their sons with fire for burnt offerings unto Baal, which I commanded</p>
<p>not, nor spake it, neither came it into my mind : therefore, behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that</p>
<p>this place shall no more be called Tophet, nor The valley of the son of Hinnom, but The valley of</p>
<p>slaughter. And I will make void the counsel of Fudah and ﬂerusalem in this place ," and I will cause</p>
<p>them to fall by the sword before their enemies, and by the hands of them that seek their lives ."</p>
<p>and their carcasses will I give to be meat for the fowls of the heaven, and for the beasts of</p>
<p>the earth. And I will make this city desolate, and a hissing ; every one that passeth thereby shall be</p>
<p>astonished and hiss, because of all the plagues thereof. And I will cause them to eat the flesh of their</p>
<p>sons and the flesh of their daughters, and they shall eat every one the flesh of his friend in the</p>
<p>siege and straitness, wherewith their enemies, and they that seek their lives, shall straiten them. Then shalt thou break the</p>
<p>bottle in the sight of the men that go with thee, and shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord</p>
<p>of hosts ; Even so will I break this people and this city, as one breaketh a potter s vessel,</p>
<p>that cannot be made whole again ." and they shall bury them in Tophet, till there be no place to</p>
<p>bury. Thus will I do unto this place, saith the Lord, and to the inhabitants thereof, and even make this</p>
<p>city as Tophet .- 3 4 5 6 I 8 I I0 11 12 1654 Feremiah 20 and the houses</p>
<p>of tierusalem, and the houses of the kings of tludah, shall be defiled as the place of Tophet, because of</p>
<p>all the houses upon whose roofs they have burned incense unto all the host of heaven, and have poured out</p>
<p>drink offerings unto other gods. Then came Feremiah from Tophet, whither the Lord had sent him to prophesy ; and</p>
<p>he stood in the court of the Lord s house, and said to all the people, Thus saith the Lord</p>
<p>of hosts, the God of Israel I 8ehold, I will bring upon this city and upon all her towns all</p>
<p>the evil that I have pronounced against it, because they have hardened their necks, that they might not hear my</p>
<p>words, 20 The Curse on Pashur for Imprisoning Feremiah Now Pashur the son of Immer the priest, who was also</p>
<p>chief governor in the house of the Lord, heard that tleremiah prophesied these things. Then Pashur smote ﬂeremiah the prophet,</p>
<p>and put him in the stocks that were in the high gate of 8en/"amin, which was by the house of</p>
<p>the Lord. And it came to pass on the morrow, that Pashur brought forth ﬂeremiah out of the stocks. Then</p>
<p>said ﬂeremiah unto him, The Lord hath not called thy name Pashur, but Magor-missabib [fear round about]. For thus saith</p>
<p>the Lord, Eehold, I will make thee a terror to thyself, and to all thy friends : and they shall</p>
<p>fall by the sword of their enemies, and thine eyes shall behold it : and I will give all Iudah</p>
<p>into the hand of the king of 8abylon, and he shall carry them captive into 8abylon, and shall slay them</p>
<p>with the sword, Moreover I will deliver all the strength of this city, and all the labors thereof, and all</p>
<p>the precious things thereof, and all the treasures of the kings of Fudah will I give into the hand</p>
