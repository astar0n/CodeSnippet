<p>at the india offite-" to beta"?! in fact bitter against london, s.w., altogether. it was he that proposed a walk through the town. the city lay sleepy and</p>
<p>listless beneath a proud and distant sky of changeless blue. idly sat the arabs on the benches outside the low- roofed coffee-houses; lazily worked the makers of ornaments</p>
<p>in the bazaars; yawningly pounded the tinkers; greedily ate the children; the city was cloyed with ease. warham, blithelygo and myself sat in the evening sun surrounded by</p>
<p>gold-and-scarlet bedizened gentry of the desert, and drank strong coffee and smoked until we too were satisfied, if not surfeited; animals like the rest. silence fell on us,</p>
<p>this was a new life to two of us; to warham it was familiar, therefore comfortable and soporific, i leaned back and languidly scanned the scene; eyes halfshut,</p>
<p>senses half-awake. an arab sheikh passed swiftly with his curtained harem; and then went filing by in orderly and bright array a number of mahommedans, the first of</p>
<p>them bearing on a Cushion of red velvet, and covered with a cloth of scarlet and gold, a dead child to burial. down from the colossal tanks built</p>
<p>in the mountain gorges that were old when mahomet was young, there came donkeys bearing great leathern bottles such as the israelites carried in their forty years soiourning,</p>
<p>a long line of swaying camels passed dustily to the desert that burns even into this city of aden, built on a volcano; groups of somaulis, lithe and</p>
<p>brawny, moved chattering here and there; and a handful of wandering horsemen, with spears and snowy garments, were being swallowed up in the mountain defiles. the day had</p>
<p>been long, the coffee and cigarettes had been heavy, and we dozed away in the sensuous atmosphere. then there came, as if in a dream, a harsh and</p>
<p>far-off murmur of voices. it grew from a murmur to a sharp cry, and from a sharp cry to a roar of rage, in a moment we were</p>
<p>on our feet, and dashing away toward the sound. the sight that greeted us was a strange one, and horribly picturesque. in front of a low-roofed house of</p>
<p>stone was a crowd of mahommedans fierce with anger and loud in imprecation, knives were flashing; murder was afoot, there stood, with his back to the door of</p>
<p>the house, a somauli policeman, defending himself against this raging little mob, not defending himself alone, within the house he had thrust a wretched /ew, who had defiled</p>
<p>a mahommedan mosque; and he was here protecting him against these nervous champions of the faith, once, twice, thrice, they reached him; but he fought on with his</p>
<p>unwounded arm. we were unarmed and helpless; no somaulis were near. death glittered in these white blades. but must this spartan die? now there was another cry, a</p>
<p>british cheer, a gleam of blue and red, a glint of steel rounding the corner at our left, and the mahommedans broke away, with a parting lunge at</p>
<p>the somauli. british soldiers took the place of the bloodthirsty mob. danger over, the somauli sank down on the threshold, fainting from loss of blood. as we looked</p>
<p>at him gashed all over, but not mortally wounded, blithelygo said with glowing triumph: "british, british, you see!" at that moment the door of the house opened, and</p>
<p>out crawled to the feet of the officer in command the miserable israelite with his red hemmed skirt and greasy face. for this cowardly creature the somauli policeman</p>
<p>had perilled his life. sublime! how could we help thinking of the talk at his excellency s table? suddenly the somauli started up and looked round anxiously. his</p>
<p>eyes fell on the few. his countenance grew peaceful. he sank back again into the arms of the surgeon and said, pointing to the son of abraham: "he</p>
<p>owe me for a donkey." maior warham looking at blithelygo said with a chilled kind of lustre to his voice: "british, so sometimes when, like mirza, i retire</p>
<p>to my little hill of bagdad for meditation, there comes before me the bright picture of hawaii with its coral-bulwarked islands and the memory of an idle sojourn</p>
<p>on their shores. i remember the rainbow-Coloured harbour of honolulu hilo, the simply foyous arcadie at the foot of mauna loa, and mauna kea which lifted violet shoulders</p>
<p>to the morning, the groves of cocoa-palms and tamarinds, the waterfalls dropping over sheer precipices a thousand feet into the ocean, the green embrasures where the mango, the</p>
<p>guava, and the lovi lovi grow, and where the hibiscus lifts red hands to the light. i call to mind the luau where kalakua, the king, presided over</p>
<p>the dispensation of stewed PUP}-"I5", lifted to one s lips by brown but fair fingers, of live shrimps, of poi and taro and balls of boiled sea-weed stuffed</p>
<p>with heaven knows what." and to crown all, or to drown all, the insinuating liquor kava, followed when the festival was done by the sensuous but fascinating hula</p>
<p>hula, danced by maidens of Varying loveliness. of these van blaricom, the american, said, "they d capture chicago in a week with that racket," and he showed</p>
