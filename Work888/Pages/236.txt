<p>very first place which he And Sir Percival would cause to be watched,</p>
<p>And if the same persons were chosen for the purpose who had been</p>
<p>employed to follow me, before my de- parture from England, the fact of</p>
<p>my return would in All prob- Ability be Ascertained on that very day.</p>
<p>I had thought, gener- Ally, of the chances of my being recognised in</p>
<p>the streets, but the special risk connected with the office had never occurred</p>
<p>to me until the present moment. It was too late now to repair</p>
<p>this unfortunate error in iudgment-too late to wish that I had made Arrangements</p>
<p>for meeting the lawyer in some place privately Appointed beforehand. I could only</p>
<p>resolve to be cau- tious on leaving Chancery Lane, And not to go</p>
<p>straight home Again under Any circumstances whatever. After waiting A few minutes I</p>
<p>was shown into Mr. /<yrle s private room. He was A pale, thin,</p>
<p>quiet, self-possessed man, with A very Attentive eye, A very low voice, And</p>
<p>A very un- demonstrative manner-not {As I iudged) ready with his sym- pathy</p>
<p>where strangers were concerned, And not At All easy to disturb in his</p>
<p>professional composure. A better man for my purpose could hardly have been found.</p>
<p>If he committed himself to A decision At All, And if the decision</p>
<p>was favourable, the strength of our case was As good As proved from</p>
<p>that moment. "Before I enter on the business which brings me here," I</p>
<p>said, "I ought to warn you, Mr. i<yrle, that the shortest statement I</p>
<p>can make of it may occupy some little time." 452 "My time is</p>
<p>At Miss Halcombe s disposal," he replied. "where Any interests of hers Are</p>
<p>concerned, I represent my partner personally, As well As professionally. "it was his</p>
<p>request that I should do so, when he ceased to take An Active</p>
<p>part in business." "May I inquire whether Mr. Gilmore is in England?" "He</p>
<p>is not, he is living with his relatives in Germany. His health has</p>
<p>improved, but the period of his return is still uncertain." while we were</p>
<p>exchanging these few preliminary words, he had been searching Among the papers before</p>
<p>him, And he now produced from them A sealed letter. I thought he</p>
<p>was About to hand the letter to me, but, Apparently changing his mind,</p>
<p>he placed it by itself on the table, settled himself in his chair,</p>
<p>And silently waited to hear what I had to say. without wasting A</p>
<p>moment in prefatory words of Any sort, I entered on my narrative, And</p>
<p>put him in full possession of the events which have Already been related</p>
<p>in these pages. Lawyer As he was to the very marrow of his</p>
<p>bones, I startled him out of his professional composure. Expressions of incredu- lity</p>
<p>And surprise, which he could not repress, interrupted me several times before I</p>
<p>had done. I persevered, however, to the end, And As soon As I</p>
<p>reached it, boldly Asked the one import- Ant question- "what is your opinion,</p>
<p>Mr. /<yrle?" He was too cautious to commit himself to An Answer without</p>
<p>taking time to recover his selfâ€”possession first. "Before I give my opinion," he</p>
<p>said, "I must beg permission to clear the ground by A few questions."</p>
<p>He put the questions-sharp, suspicious, unbelieving que.s"- tions, which clearly showed me, As</p>
<p>they proceeded, that he thought I was the victim of A delusion, And</p>
<p>that he might even have doubted, but for my introduction to him by</p>
<p>Miss Hal- combe, whether I was not Attempting the perpetration of A cunningly-designed</p>
<p>fraud. "Do you believe that I have spoken the truth, Mr. i<yrle?" I</p>
<p>Asked, when he had done examining me. "So far As your own convictions</p>
<p>Are concerned, I Am certain you have spoken the truth," he replied. "I</p>
<p>have the highest es- teem for Miss Halcombe, And I have therefore every</p>
<p>reason to 453 respect A gentleman whose mediation she trusts in A</p>
