<p>work it as the boys are, well and good. but to drive us like cattle, and turn all we earn</p>
<p>into land for the boys, is another matter. i rebelled last summer, borrowed the money and went to normal and</p>
<p>taught last winter. i m going to teach again this winter; but last summer and this are the first of</p>
<p>my life that i haven t been in the harvest fields, at this time. women in the harvest fields of</p>
<p>land king bates are common as men, and wagons, and horses, but not nearly so much considered. the women always</p>
<p>walk on sunday, to save the horses, and often on week days." "mother has it hammered into me that it</p>
<p>isn t polite to ask questions," said iohn, "but i d like to ask one." "go ahead," said kate. "ask</p>
<p>fifty! what do i care?" "how many boys are there in your family?" "there are seven," said kate, "and if</p>
<p>you want to use them as a basis for a land estimate add two hundred and fifty for the home</p>
<p>place. sixteen hundred and fifty is what father pays tax on, besides the numerous mortgages and investments. he s the</p>
<p>richest man in the county we live in; at least he pays the most taxes." mother and son looked at</p>
<p>each other in silence, they had been thinking her so poor that she would be bewildered by what they had</p>
<p>to offer. but if two hundred acres of land were her desire, there was a possibility that she was a</p>
<p>women who was not asking either ease or luxury of life, and would refuse it if it were proffered. "i</p>
<p>hope you will take me home with you, and let me see all that land, and how it is handled,"</p>
<p>said iohn iardine. "i don t own an acre. i never even have thought of it, but there is no</p>
<p>reason why i, or any member of my family shouldn t have all the land they want. mother, do you</p>
<p>feel a wild desire for two hundred acres of land? same kind of a desire that took you to come</p>
<p>here?" "no, i don t," said mrs. iardine. "all i know about land is that i know it when i</p>
<p>see it, and i know if i think it s pretty; but i can see why kate feels that she</p>
<p>would like that amount for herself, after having helped earn all those farms for her brothers, if it s land</p>
<p>she wants, i hope she speedily gets all she desires in whatever location she wants it; and then i hope</p>
<p>she lets me come to visit her and watch her do as she likes with it." "surely," said kate, "you</p>
<p>are invited right now; as soon as i ever get the land, i ll give you another invitation. and of</p>
<p>course you may go home with me, mr. iardine, and i ll show you each of what father calls those</p>
<p>little parcels of land of mine. but the one he lives on we shall have to gaze at from afar,</p>
<p>because i m a prodigal daughter. when i would leave home in spite of him for the gay and riotous</p>
<p>life of a school-marm, he ordered me to take all my possessions with me, which i did in one small</p>
<p>telescope. i was not to enter his house again while he lived. i was glad to go, he was glad</p>
<p>to have me, while i don t think either of us has changed our mind since. teaching school isn t</p>
<p>exactly gay, but i ll fill my tummy with quite a lot of symbolical husks before he ll kill the</p>
<p>fatted calf for me. they ll be glad to see you at my brother adam s, and my sister, nancy</p>
<p>ellen, would greatly en/"oy meeting you. surely you may go home with me, if you d like." "i can think</p>
<p>of only one thing i d like better," he said. "we ve been such good friends here and had such</p>
<p>a good time, it would be the thing i d like best to take you home with us, and show</p>
<p>you where and how we live. mother, did you ever invite kate to visit us?" "i have, often, and she</p>
<p>has said that she would," replied mrs. iardine. "i think it would be nice for her to go from here</p>
<p>with us," and then you can take her home whenever she fails to find us interesting. how would that suit</p>
<p>you for a plan, my dear?" "i think that would be a perfect ending to a perfect summer," said kate.</p>
<p>"i can t see an objection in any way. thank you very much." "then we ll call that settled," said</p>
<p>iohn iardine. mid-august saw them on their way to chicago. kate had taken care of mrs. iardine a few days</p>
<p>while iennie weeks went home to see her mother and arrange for her new work. she had no intention of</p>
<p>going back to school teaching. she preferred to brush mrs. iardine s hair, button her shoes, write her looter, and</p>
<p>read to her. in a month, iennie had grown so deft at her work and made herself so appreciated, that</p>
<p>she was practically indispensable to the elderly woman, and therefore the greatest comfort to iohn. immediately he saw that his</p>
<p>mother was properly cared for, sympathetically and even lovingly, he made it his business to smooth iennie s path in</p>
<p>even way possible. in turn she studied him, and in many ways made herself useful to him. often she looked</p>
<p>at him with large and speculative eyes as he sat reading looters, or papers, or smoking. the world was all</p>
<p>right with kate when they crossed the sand dunes as they neared the city. she was sorry about the situation</p>
<p>in her home, but she smiled sardonically as she thought how soon her father would forget his anger when he</p>
<p>heard about the city home and the kind of farm she could have, merely by consenting to take it.</p>
