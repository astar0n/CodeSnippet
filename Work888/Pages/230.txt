<p>fully risen, though unseen behind the storm-clouds, The moon had</p>
<p>lost all of its luster, and was like a white</p>
<p>cloud in the sky. Not a single star could be</p>
<p>seen. The sedge, silvery with dew before, now shone like</p>
<p>gold. The stagnant pools were all like amber. The blue</p>
<p>of the grass had changed to yellow-green. The marsh birds</p>
<p>twittered and swarmed about the brook and upon the bushes</p>
<p>that glittered with dew and cast long shadows. A hawk</p>
<p>woke up and settled on a haycock, turning its head</p>
<p>from side to side and looking discontentedly at the marsh.</p>
<p>Crows were flying about the field, and a bare-legged boy</p>
<p>was driving the horses to an old man, who had</p>
<p>got up from under his long coat and was combing</p>
<p>his hair. The smoke from the gun was white as</p>
<p>milk over the green of the grass. I28I of II5I</p>
<p>Anna kzarenina One of the boys ran up to Levin.</p>
<p>Uncle, there were ducks here yesterday! he shouted to him,</p>
<p>and he walked a little way off behind him. And</p>
<p>Levin was doubly pleased, in sight of the boy, who</p>
<p>expressed his approval, at killing three snipe, one after another,</p>
<p>straight off. 1288 of 1I5I Anna Karenina Chapter 13 The</p>
<p>sportsman s saying, that if the first beast or the</p>
<p>first bird is not missed, the day will be lucky,</p>
<p>turned out correct. At ten o clock Levin, weary, hungry,</p>
<p>and happy after a tramp of twenty miles, returned to</p>
<p>his night s lodging with nineteen head of fine game</p>
<p>and one duck, which he tied to his belt, as</p>
<p>it would not go into the game bag. His companions</p>
<p>had long been awake, and had had time to get</p>
<p>hungry and have breakfast. wait a bit, wait a bit,</p>
<p>4 know there are nineteen, said Wvin, counting a second</p>
<p>time over the grouse and snipe, that looked so much</p>
<p>less important now, bent and dry and bloodstained, with heads</p>
<p>crooked aside, than they did when they "were flying. The</p>
<p>number was verified, and Stepan Arkadyevitch s envy pleased Levin.</p>
<p>He was pleased too on returning to find the man</p>
<p>sent by /<:itty with a note was already there. I</p>
<p>am perfectly well and happy. If you were uneasy about</p>
<p>me, you can feel easier than ever. I ve a</p>
<p>new bodyguard, Marya Vlasyevna, - this was the midwife, a</p>
<p>new and important personage in Levin s domestic life. 128I</p>
<p>of 1I5I Anna kiarenina She has come to have a</p>
<p>look at me. She found me perfectly well, and we</p>
<p>have kept her till you are back. All are happy</p>
<p>and well, and please, don t be in a hurry</p>
<p>to come back, but, if the sport is good, stay</p>
<p>another day. These two pleasures, his lucky shooting and the</p>
<p>letter from his wife, were so great that two slightly</p>
<p>disagreeable incidents passed lightly over Levin. One was that the</p>
<p>chest nut trace horse, who had been unmistakably overworked on the</p>
<p>previous day, was off his feed and out of sorts.</p>
<p>The coachman said he was Overdriven yesterday, kconstantin Dmitrievitch. Yes,</p>
<p>indeed! driven ten miles with no sense! The other unpleasant</p>
<p>incident, which for the first minute destroyed his good humor,</p>
<p>though later he laughed at it a great deal, was</p>
<p>to find that of all the provisions /<:itty had</p>
