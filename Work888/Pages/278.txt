<p>his own name. his mind must be totally blown. did she know? did he know? what now? with the ticket</p>
<p>agent still yﬁlling, he d quickly disappeared into the crowd, having no choice but to pace a departure lounge for</p>
<p>an hour and a half, then take the only remaining london flight of the evening. all right, he d thought</p>
<p>after cooling down, novosty wants to use you." maybe you can use him. but now he suspected things weren t</p>
<p>going to be that simple. he remembered the two kgb operatives alex had shot and killed at knossos. they d</p>
<p>been there to find eva, which meant they knew she had something. now he realized that wasn t all they</p>
<p>knew. across the aisle in first class sat a tall, willowy woman who radiated all the self-confidence of a seasoned</p>
<p>european traveler. she was also elegantly beautiful-with dark eyes, auburn hair, and pursed red lips-and she carried a large brown</p>
<p>leather purse, florentine. she could have been a french fashion model, a high-paid american cosmetics executive, a spanish diplomat s</p>
<p>mistress. the problem was, vance knew, she was none of those things. the french passport he d seen her brandish</p>
<p>at the greek behind the glass windows at emigration control was a forgery. she was neither french, nor american, nor</p>
<p>spanish. she was an executive vice president with techmashimport, the importing cover for t-directorate. kgb. vera karanova was always a</p>
<p>prominent presence at western trade shows. but there was no trade show in london now, no new high-tech toys to</p>
<p>be dangled before the wondering eyes of techmashimport, which routinely arranged to try and obtain restricted computers, surveillance gear, weapons-systems</p>
<p>blueprints. so why s comrade karanova on this flight? off to buy a designer dress at a sloane street boutique?</p>
<p>catch the latest west end musical? how about the simplest answer of all: she s going to help them track</p>
<p>alex novosty to earth. or grab eva. or both. they re about to tighten the noose. so the nightmare was</p>
<p>still on. the kgb must have had the airport under surveillance, and somebody spotted novosty-or was it eva?-getting on the</p>
<p>british air flight to london. now they "were closing in. does she know me? vance wondered. my photo s in</p>
<p>their files somewhere, surely. but she d betrayed no hint of recognition. so maybe not. he d always worked away</p>
<p>from the limelight as much as possible. once more it had paid off. as the plane dipped and shuddered from</p>
<p>the turbulence, he watched out of the corner of his eye as she lifted the fake french passport out of</p>
<p>her open leather handbag, now nestled in the empty seat by the window, and began copying the number onto her</p>
<p>landing card. very unprofessional, he thought. you always memorize the numbers on a forgery. first rule. t-directorate s getting sloppy</p>
<p>these days. he waited till she d finished, then leaned over and ran his hand roughly down the arm of</p>
<p>her blue silk blouse. "etes-vous aller a londres pour du commerce?" he deliberately made his french as american-accented as possible.</p>
<p>"comment?" she glanced up, annoyed, and removed his hand. "ﬁxcusez moi, que dites-vous?" "d affaires?" he grinned and craned to</p>
<p>look at the front of her open neckline. "business?" "oui . . . yes." she switched quickly to english, her</p>
<p>relief almost too obvious. "get over there often?" he pushed. "from time to time." no fooling, lady. you ve been</p>
<p>in london four times since 88, by actual count, setting up phony third-party pass-through deals. "just business, huh?" he grinned</p>
<p>again, then looked up at the liquor service being unveiled in the galley. the turbulence had subsided slightly and the</p>
<p>attendants were trying to restore normality, at least in first class. "what do you say to a drink?" she beckoned</p>
<p>the approaching steward, hoping to outflank this obnoxious american across the aisle. "vodka and tonic, please." "same as the lady</p>
<p>s having, pal." he gave the young englishman a wink and a thumbs-up sign, then turned back. "by the way,</p>
<p>i m booked in at the holiday inn over by marble arch. great room service. almost like home. you staying</p>
<p>around there?" "no." she watched the steward P§ur her drink. "sorry to hear that. i was wondering, maybe we .</p>
<p>. . do these business trips of yours include taking some time off? let you in on a secret, /"ust</p>
<p>between you and me. i know this little club in soho where they have live-" he winked, "i got a</p>
<p>membership. tell you one thing, there s nothing like it in chicago." "i m afraid i ll be busy," "too</p>
<p>bad." he drew on his drink, then continued. "long stay this trip?" "if you ll excuse me, mr. -" "warner.</p>
<p>william /". warner. friends call me bill." "mr. warner, i ve had a very trying day. so, if you don</p>
<p>t mind, i d like to attempt to get some rest." "sure. you make yourself comfortable, now." he watched as</p>
<p>she shifted to the window seat, as far as possible from him, and stationed her leather handbag onto the aisle</p>
<p>side. just then the plane hit another air pocket, rattling the liquor bottles in the galley. "maybe we ll catch</p>
<p>up with each other in london," he yelled. "most unlikely." she elared as she gulped the last of her drink,</p>
<p>then carefully rotated to the window and adjusted her seat to full recline. her face disappeared. good riddance. after that</p>
<p>the flight went smoothly for a few minutes, and michael vance began to worry. but then the turbulence resumed, shutting</p>
<p>down drink service as their puny airplane again became a toy rattle in the hands of the gods, thirty thousand</p>
<p>feet over the mediterranean, buffeted by the powerful, unseen gusts of a spring storm. for a moment he found himself</p>
<p>envying zeno, who had only the churning sea to face. almost hesitantly he unbuckled his seat belt and pulled himself</p>
<p>up, balancing with one hand as he reached in the air to grapple drunkenly with the overhead baggage compartment.</p>
