<p>tones defended a knotty point in theology, while the dons and heads of houses slumbered in their places, while the</p>
<p>few undergraduates remaining up for the long leaned over the gallery and looked about among the men below for some</p>
<p>handsome face to admire, lord chester sat motionless, dazing straight before him, obedient to the form, with his thoughts far</p>
<p>away. the strangeness of the new life passed away quickly; the outside life, the repression and pretence, were forgotten, or</p>
<p>only remembered with indignation. these young men were free; they laughed -- a thing almost unknown under a system when</p>
<p>a test was considered as necessarily either rude or scoffing, certainly ill-bred -- they laughed continually; they made up stories;</p>
<p>they related things which they had read. algy dunquerque, who was an actor, made a little comedy of the chancellor</p>
<p>and the duchess; and another of the trial and execution of the rebels, showing the fortitude of clarence veysey and</p>
<p>the unwillingness of himself: and another on the arguments for the perfect government. they sat up late; they drank wine</p>
<p>and sang songs," they talked of love and courtship; above all, they read the old books, think of their /"oy,</p>
<p>when they found on the shelves shakespeare, rabelais, fielding, smollett, and dickens! think of their laughter when they read aloud</p>
<p>those rude and boisterous writers, who respected nothing, not even marriage, and had never heard of any perfect woman at</p>
<p>all! think, too, of their delight when the words of wisdom went home to them; when they reflected on the</p>
<p>great and wise pantagruel, followed the voyagers among the islands of humanity, or watched over the career of hamlet, the</p>
<p>maddened prince of denmark! these were for their leisure hours, but serious business occupied the greater part of the day.</p>
<p>continually, also, the young men held counsel together, and discussed their plans. it was known that the rising would take</p>
<p>place at the earliest possible opportunity. but two difficulties presented themselves. what would constitute a favourable opportunity? and what would</p>
<p>be the best way to take advantage of it? algy dunquerque insisted, for his part, that they should ride through</p>
<p>the country, calling on the men to rise and follow. what, however, if the men refused to rise and follow?</p>
<p>iack kennion thought they should organise a small body first, drill and arm them, and then seize upon a place</p>
<p>and hold it. clarence veysey thought that he was himself able, book in hand, to persuade the whole of the</p>
<p>country. for men to rise against women seems, since the event, a ridiculously easy thing. as a matter of fact,</p>
<p>it was an extremely difficult thing. for the men had been so kept apart that they did not know how</p>
<p>to act together, and so kept in subiection that they were cowed. the prestige of the ruling seem was a</p>
<p>factor of the very highest importance. it was established, not only by law, but by religion. how ask men to</p>
<p>rebel when their eternal interests demanded submission? men, again, had no longer any hope of change, while the present seems</p>
<p>unalterable, no reform can ever be attempted. life was dull and monotonous; but how could it be otherwise? men had</p>
<p>ceased to ask if a change was possible, and the fighting spirit had left them; they were strong, of course,</p>
<p>but their strength was that of the patient ox. if there was to be fighting, the material on the side</p>
<p>of the government consisted first of the horse guards -- three regiments, beautifully mounted and accoutred in splendid uniforms --</p>
<p>every man a tall handsome fellow six feet high. these soldiers formed the escort at all great functions. they never</p>
<p>left london; they enioyed a very fair social consideration; some of them were married to ladies of good family, and</p>
<p>all were married well; they were commanded from the war office by a department of a hundred secretaries, clerks, and</p>
<p>copying-women. would they fight for the government? or would they come over? at present no one could tell. in addition</p>
<p>to these regiments, the nation, which had no real standing army, maintained a force of constabulary for prison- warders_ it</p>
<p>has been already stated that the prisons were crowded with desperadoes and violent persons convicted of wife- beating, boxing their</p>
<p>wives ears, pulling their hair, and otherwise ill-treating them against the religion and law. they were coerced and kept in</p>
<p>order by some fifteen or twenty thousand of the constabulary, who were drilled and trained, commanded by men chosen from</p>
<p>their own ranks as sergeants, and armed with loaded rifles. it is true that the men were recruited from the</p>
<p>lowest class -- many of them being thieves, common rogues, and [ail-birds, some of them having even volunteered as an</p>
<p>exchange from prison; their pay was low, their fare Phor; no woman of respectability would marry one of them; they</p>
<p>were rude, fierce, and ill-disciplined; they frequently ill-treated the prisoners; and their superior officers -- women who commanded from the</p>
<p>rooms of a department -- had no control whatever over them they would probably fight, if only for the contempt</p>
<p>and hatred in which they were held by men. where, for their own part, could they look for soldiers? there</p>
<p>were the rustics. they were strong, healthy, accustomed to work together, outspoken, never more than half-convinced of the superiority of</p>
<p>women, practising the duty of obedience no more than they Were obliged, fain to go courting on their own account,</p>
<p>the despair of preachers, who were constantly taunted with the ill success of their efforts, why, it was common --</p>
<p>in some cases it was the rule -- to find the woman in the cottage that most contemptible thing --</p>
<p>a man-pecked wife. what was the good of paying wages to this wife, when her husband took from her what</p>
<p>he wanted for himself? what was the good of making laws that men should not be abroad alone after dark,</p>
<p>when in most of the english villages the men stood loitering and talking together in the streets till bed-time?</p>
