<p>brought to you by But here s this lady too,</p>
<p>and others very much moved as well." it s very</p>
<p>natural, Alexey Alexandrovitch told himself. He tried not to look</p>
<p>at her, but unconsciously his eyes were drawn to her.</p>
<p>He examined that face again, trying not to read what</p>
<p>was so plainly written on it, and against his own</p>
<p>will, with horror read on it what he did not</p>
<p>want to know. The first fall-kcuzovlev s, at the stream-agitated</p>
<p>everyone, but Alexey Alexandrovitch saw distinctly on Anna s pale,</p>
<p>triumphant face that the man she was watching had not</p>
<p>fallen. when, after Mahotin and Vronsky had cleared the worst</p>
<p>barrier, the next officer had been thrown straight on his</p>
<p>head at it and fatally iniured, and a shudder of</p>
<p>horror passed over the whole public, Alexey Alexandrovitch saw that</p>
<p>Anna did not even notice it, and had some difficulty</p>
<p>in realizing what they were talking of about her. But</p>
<p>more and more often, and with greater persistence, he watched</p>
<p>her. Anna, wholly engrossed as she was with the race,</p>
<p>became aware of her husband s cold eyes fixed upon</p>
<p>her from one side. She glanced round for an instant,</p>
<p>looked inquiringly at him, and with a slight frown turned</p>
<p>away again. Ah, I don t care! she seemed to</p>
<p>say to him, and she did not once {lance at</p>
<p>him again. 45I of 1I5I Anna Karenina The race was</p>
<p>an unlucky one, and of the seventeen officers who rode</p>
<p>in it more than half were thrown and hurt. Towards</p>
<p>the end of the race everyone was in a state</p>
<p>of agitation, which was intensified by the fact that the</p>
<p>Tsar was displeased. 460 of 1I5I Anna Karenina Chapter 2I</p>
<p>Everyone was loudly expressing disapprobation, everyone was repeating a phrase</p>
<p>some one had uttered- The lions and gladiators will be</p>
<p>the next thing, and everyone was feeling horrified." so that</p>
<p>when Vronsky fell to the ground, and Anna moaned aloud,</p>
<p>there was nothing very out of the way in it.</p>
<p>8ut afterwards a change came over Anna s face which</p>
<p>really was beyond decorum. She utterly lost her head. She</p>
<p>began fluttering like a caged bird, at one moment would</p>
<p>have got up and moved away, at the next turned</p>
<p>to Betsy. Let us go, let us go! she said.</p>
<p>Eut Betsy did not hear her. She was bending down,</p>
<p>talking to a general who had come up to her.</p>
<p>Alexey Alexandrovitch went up to Anna and courteously offered her</p>
<p>his arm. Let us go, if you like, he said</p>
<p>in French, but Anna was listening to the general and</p>
<p>did not notice her husband, He s broken his leg</p>
<p>too, so they say, the general was saying. This is</p>
<p>beyond everything. without answering her husband, Anna lifted her opera</p>
<p>glass and gazed towards the place where Vronsky had 461</p>
<p>of 1I5I Anna Karenina fallen; but it was so far</p>
<p>off, and there was such a crowd of people about</p>
<p>it, that she could make out nothing. She laid down</p>
<p>the opera glass, and would have moved away, but at</p>
<p>that moment an officer galloped up and made some announcement</p>
<p>to the Tsar. Anna craned forward, listening. Stiva! Stiva! she</p>
<p>cried to her brother. But her brother did not hear</p>
<p>her. Again she would have moved away. Once more</p>
