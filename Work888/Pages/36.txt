<p>and love them for all that they have meant in the past. yes, it was the olive-green line of scott s novels which started me on to rhapsody.</p>
<p>they were the first books i ever owned---long, long before i could appreciate or even understand them. but at last i realized what a treasure they were. in</p>
<p>my boyhood i read them by surreptitious candle-ends in the dead of the night, when the sense of crime added a new zest to the story. perhaps you</p>
<p>have observed that my "ivanhoe" is of a different edition from the others, the first copy was left in the grass by the side of a stream, fell</p>
<p>into the water, and was eventually picked up three days later, swollen and decomposed, upon a mud-bank. i think i may say, however, that i had worn it</p>
<p>out before i lost it. indeed, it was perhaps as well that it was some years before it was replaced, for my instinct was always to read it</p>
<p>again instead of breaking fresh ground. i remember the late iames payn telling the anecdote that he and two literary friends agreed to write down what scene in</p>
<p>fiction they thought the most dramatic, and that on examining the papers it was found that all three had chosen the same. it was the moment when the</p>
<p>unknown knight, at ashby-de-la-zouch, riding past the pavilions of the lesser men, strikes with the sharp end of his lance, in a challenge to mortal combat, the shield</p>
<p>of the formidable templar. it was, indeed, a splendid moment! what matter that no templar was allowed by the rules of his order to take part in so</p>
<p>secular and frivolous an affair as a tournament? it is the privilege of great masters to make things so, and it is a churlish thing to gainsay it.</p>
<p>was it not wendell holmes who described the prosaic man, who enters a drawing-room with a couple of facts, like ill-conditioned bull-dogs at his heels, ready to let</p>
<p>them loose on any play of fancy? the great writer can never go wrong. if shakespeare gives a sea-coast to bohemia, or if victor hugo calls an english</p>
<p>prize-fighter mr, /"im-/"ohn-jack---well, it was so, and that s an end of it. "there is no second line of rails at that point," said an editor to a</p>
<p>minor author. "i make a second line," said the author; and he was within his rights, if he can carry his readers conviction with him. but this is</p>
<p>a digression from "ivanhoe." what a book it is! the second greatest historical novel in our language, i think. every successive reading has deepened my admiration for it.</p>
<p>scott s soldiers are always as good as his women (with exceptions} are weak; but here, while the soldiers are at their very best, the romantic figure of</p>
<p>rebecca redeems the female side of the story from the usual commonplace routine. scott drew manly men because he was a manly man himself, and found the task</p>
<p>a sympathetic one. he drew young heroines because a convention demanded it, which he had never the hardihood to break. it is only when we get him for</p>
<p>a dozen chapters on end with a minimum of petticoat---in the long stretch, for example, from the beginning of the tournament to the end of the friar tuck</p>
<p>incident---that we realize the height of continued romantic narrative to which he could attain. i don t think in the whole range of our literature we have a</p>
<p>finer sustained flight than that. there is, i admit, an intolerable amount of redundant verbiage in scott s novels. those endless and unnecessary introductions make the shell very</p>
<p>thick before you come to the oyster. they are often admirable in themselves, learned, witty, picturesque, but with no relation or proportion to the story which they are</p>
<p>supposed to introduce. like so much of our english fiction, they are very good matter in a very bad place. digression and want of method and order are</p>
<p>traditional national sins, fancy introducing an essay on how to live on nothing a year as thackeray did in "vanity fair," or sandwiching in a ghost story as</p>
<p>dickens has dared to do. as well might a dramatic author rush up to the footlights and begin telling anecdotes while his play was suspending its action and</p>
<p>his characters waiting wearily behind him. it is all wrong, though every great name can be quoted in support of it. our sense of form is lamentably lacking,</p>
<p>and sir walter sinned with the rest. but get past all that to a crisis in the real story, and who finds the terse phrase, the short fire-word,</p>
<p>so surely as he." do you remember when the reckless sergeant of dragoons stands at last before the grim puritan, upon whose head a price has been set:</p>
<p>"a thousand marks or a bed of heather!" says he, as he draws. the puritan draws also: "the sword of the lord and of gideon!" says he. no</p>
<p>verbiage there! but the very spirit of either man and of either party, in the few stern words, which haunt your mind. "bows and bills!" cry the</p>
