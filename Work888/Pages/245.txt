<p>c."ath- erick see Miss Fairlie?" "Certainly not," replied Miss Halcombe,</p>
<p>"Did she see you?" "No." "She saw nobody from the</p>
<p>house then, except A certain Mr. Hartright, who Accidentally met</p>
<p>with her in the churchyard here?" "Nobody else." "Mr. Hartright</p>
<p>was employed At Limmeridge As A drawing- master, I believe?</p>
<p>Is he A member of one of the water-Colour Societies?"</p>
<p>"I believe he is," Answered Miss Halcombe. He paused for</p>
<p>A moment, As if he was thinking over the last</p>
<p>Answer, And then Added- "Did you find out where Anne</p>
<p>Catherick was living, when she was in this neighbourhood?" "Yes,</p>
<p>At A farm on the moor, called Todd s Corner."</p>
<p>"It is A duty we All owe to the poor</p>
<p>creature herself to trace her," continued Sir Percival. "She may</p>
<p>have said something At Todd s Corner which may help</p>
<p>us to find her. I will go there And make</p>
<p>inquiries on the chance. In the meantime, As I cannot</p>
<p>prevail on myself to discuss this painful sub/"ect with Miss</p>
<p>Fairlie, may I beg, Miss Halcombe, that you will kindly</p>
<p>under- take to give her the necessary explanation, deferring it</p>
<p>of course until you have received the reply to that</p>
<p>note." 136 Miss Halcombe promised to comply with his request.</p>
<p>He thanked her, nodded pleasantly, And left us, to go</p>
<p>And establish himself in his own room, As he opened</p>
<p>the door the cross- grained greyhound poked out her sharp</p>
<p>muzzle from under the sofa, And barked And snapped At</p>
<p>him. "A good morning s work, Miss Halcombe," I said,</p>
<p>As soon As we were Alone. "Here is An Anxious</p>
<p>day well ended Already." "Yes," she Answered; "no doubt. I</p>
<p>Am very glad your mind is satisfied." "My mind! Surely,</p>
<p>with that note in your hand, your mind is At</p>
<p>ease too?" "Oh yes-how can it be otherwise." I know</p>
<p>the thing could not be," she went on, speaking more</p>
<p>to herself than to me; "but I Almost wish walter</p>
<p>Hartright had stayed here long enough to be present At</p>
<p>the explanation, And to hear the proposal to me to</p>
<p>write this note." I was A little surprised-perhaps A little</p>
<p>piqued Also-by these last words. "Events, it is true, connected</p>
<p>Mr. Hartright very remarkably with the Affair of the letter,"</p>
<p>I said," "And I readily Admit that he conducted himself,</p>
<p>All things considered, with great delicacy And discretion. 8ut I</p>
<p>Am quite At A loss to understand what use- ful</p>
<p>influence his presence could have exercised in relation to the</p>
<p>effect of Sir Percival s statement on your mind or</p>
<p>mine." "It was only A fancy," she said Absently. "There</p>
<p>is no need to discuss it, Mr. Gilmore. Your experience</p>
<p>ought to be, And is, the best guide I can</p>
<p>desire." I did not Altogether like her thrusting the whole</p>
<p>responsibil- ity, in this marked manner, on my shoulders. If</p>
<p>Mr. Fairlie had done it, I should not have been</p>
<p>surprised. But resolute, clear- minded Miss Halcombe was the very</p>
<p>last person in the world whom I should have expected</p>
<p>to find shrinking from the ex- pression of An opinion</p>
<p>of her own. "If Any doubts still trouble you," I</p>
<p>said, "why not mention them to me At once? Tell</p>
<p>me plainly, have you Any reason to distrust Sir Percival</p>
<p>Glyde?" "None whatever." "Do you see Anything improbable, or</p>
