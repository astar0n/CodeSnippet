<p>be confuted, however preposterous his assertions. good-bye! read porson! goodbye!" he shook the invalid s hand, gave a iaunty wave of his broad-brimmed hat, and darted out of</p>
<p>the room with the same elasticity and energy with which he had entered it. the footman had already opened the great folding door to usher the illustrious visitor</p>
<p>to his carriage, when a lady stepped from the drawing-room and touched him on the sleeve. from behind the half- closed portiere of stamped velvet a little pale</p>
<p>face peeped out, half-curious, half-frightened. "may i have one word?" "surely, lady clara." "i hope it is not intrusive. i would not for the world overstep the limits----"</p>
<p>"my dear lady clara!" interrupted the prime minister, with a youthful bow and wave. "pray do not answer me if i go too far. but i know that</p>
<p>lord arthur sibthorpe has applied for tangier. would it be a liberty if i asked you what chance he has?" "the post is filled up." "oh!" in the</p>
<p>foreground and background there was a disappointed face. "and lord arthur has it." the prime minister chuckled over his little piece of roguery. "we have just decided it,"</p>
<p>he continued. "lord arthur must go in a week. i am delighted to perceive, lady clara, that the appointment has your approval. tangier is a place of extraordinary</p>
<p>interest. catherine of braganza and colonel kirke will occur to your memory. burton has written well upon northern africa. i dine at windsor, so i am sure that</p>
<p>you will excuse my leaving you. i trust that lord charles will be better. he can hardly fail to be so with such a nurse." he bowed, waved,</p>
<p>and was off down the steps to his brougham. as he drove away, lady clara could see that he was already deeply absorbed in a paper-covered novel. she</p>
<p>pushed back the velvet curtains, and returned into the drawing-room. her daughter stood in the sunlight by the window, tall, fragile, and exquisite, her features and outline not</p>
<p>unlike her mother s, but frailer, softer, more delicate. the golden light struck one half of her high-bred, sensitive face, and glimmered upon her thickly-coiled flaxen hair, striking</p>
<p>a pinkish tint from her closely-cut costume of fawn-coloured cloth with its dainty cinnamon ruchings. one little soft frill of chiffon nestled round her throat, from which the</p>
<p>white, graceful neck and well-poised head shot up like a lily amid moss. her thin white hands were pressed together, and her blue eyes turned beseechingly upon her</p>
<p>mother. "silly girl! silly girl!" said the matron, answering that imploring look. she put her hands upon her daughter s sloping shoulders and drew her towards her. "it</p>
<p>is a very nice place for a short time. it will be a stepping stone." "but oh." mamma, in a week! poor arthur!" "he will be happy." "what!</p>
<p>happy to part?" "he need not part, you shall go with him." "oh! mammal" "yes, i say it." "oh! mamma, in a week?" "yes indeed. a great deal</p>
<p>may be done in a week. i shall order your trousseau to-day." "oh! you dear, sweet angel." but i am so frightened! and papa." oh! dear, i am</p>
<p>so frightened!" "your papa is a diplomatist, dear." "yes, ma." "but, between ourselves, he married a diplomatist too. if he can manage the british empire, i think that</p>
<p>i can manage him, ida. how long have you been engaged, child?" "ten weeks, mamma." "then it is quite time it came to a head. lord arthur cannot</p>
<p>leave england without you. you must go to tangier as the minister s wife. now, you will sit there on the settee, dear, and let me manage entirely.</p>
<p>there is sir william s carriage! i do think that i know how to manage sir william. iames, lust ask the doctor to step in this way!" a</p>
<p>heavy, two-horsed carriage had drawn up at the door, and there came a single stately thud upon the knocker. an instant afterwards the drawing-room door flew open and</p>
<p>the footman ushered in the famous physician. he was a small man, clean-shaven, with the old-fashioned black dress and white cravat with high-standing collar. he swung his golden</p>
<p>pince- nez in his right hand as he walked, and bent forward with a peering, blinking expression, which was somehow suggestive of the dark and complex cases through</p>
<p>which he had seen. "ah" said he, as he entered. "my young patient! i am glad of the opportunity." "yes, i wish to speak to you about her,</p>
<p>sir william. pray take this arm-chair." "thank you, i will sit beside her," said be, taking his place upon the settee. "she is looking better, less anaemic unquestionably,</p>
<p>and a fuller pulse, quite a little tinge of colour, and yet not hectic," "i feel stronger, sir william." "but she still has the pain in the side."</p>
<p>"ah, that pain!" he tapped lightly under the collar-bones, and then bent forward with his biaural stethoscope in either ear. "still a trace of dulness--still a slight crepitation,"</p>
<p>he murmured. "you spoke of a change, doctor." "yes, certainly a iudicious change might be advisable." "you said a dry climate. i wish to do to the</p>
