<p>type! I Am capable of the most exalted Acts of</p>
<p>virtue-when I have the 335 chance of performing them. It</p>
<p>has been the misfortune of my life that I have</p>
<p>had few chances. My conception of friendship is sublime! Is</p>
<p>it my fault that your skeleton has peeped out At</p>
<p>me? why do I confess my curiosity? You poor superficial</p>
<p>Eng- lishman, it is to magnify my own self-control. I</p>
<p>Could draw your secret out of you, if I liked,</p>
<p>As I draw this finger out of the palm of</p>
<p>my hand-you know I could! But you have Appealed to</p>
<p>my friendship, And the duties of friendship Are sacred to</p>
<p>me, See! I trample my base curiosity under my feet.</p>
<p>My exalted senti- ments lift me Above it. Recognise them,</p>
<p>Percival." imitate them, Percival! Shake hands-I forgive you." His voice</p>
<p>faltered over the last words-faltered, As if he were Actually</p>
<p>shedding tears! Sir Percival confusedly Attempted to excuse himself, but</p>
<p>the Count was too magnanimous to listen to him. "No!"</p>
<p>he said, "when my friend has wounded me, I can</p>
<p>par- don him without Apologies. Tell me, in plain words,</p>
<p>do you want my help?" "Yes, badly enough." "And you</p>
<p>can Ask for it without compromising yourself?" "I can try,</p>
<p>At Any rate." "Try, then." "well, this is how it</p>
<p>stands:-I told you to-day that I had done my best</p>
<p>to find Anne (atherick, And failed." "Yes, you did." "Fosco!</p>
<p>I m A lost man if I DON T find</p>
<p>her," "Ha! Is it so serious As that?" A little</p>
<p>stream of light travelled out under the verandah, And fell</p>
<p>over the gravel-walk. The Count had taken the lamp from</p>
<p>the inner part of the room to see his friend</p>
<p>clearly by the light of it. "Yes!" he said. "Your</p>
<p>face speaks the truth this time. Serious, indeed-As serious As</p>
<p>the money matters themselves." "More serious. As true As I</p>
<p>sit here, more serious!" The light disappeared Again And the</p>
<p>talk went on. "I showed you the letter to my</p>
<p>wife that Anne Catherick hid in the sand," Sir Percival</p>
<p>continued. "There s no boasting in that letter, Fosco-she DOES</p>
<p>know the Secret." "Say As little As possible, Percival, in</p>
<p>my presence, of the Secret. Does she know it from</p>
<p>you?" 336 "No, from her mother." "Two women in possession</p>
<p>of your private mind-bad, bad, bad, my friend! One question</p>
<p>here, before we go Any farther. The motive of your</p>
<p>shutting up the daughter in the Asylum is now plain</p>
<p>enough to me, but the manner of her escape is</p>
<p>not quite so clear. Do you suspect the people in</p>
<p>charge of her of closing their eyes purposely, At the</p>
<p>instance of some enemy who could Afford to make it</p>
<p>worth their while?" "No, she was the best-behaved patient they</p>
<p>had-And, like fools, they trusted her. She s just mad</p>
<p>enough to be shut up, And just sane enough to</p>
<p>ruin me when she s At large-if you un- derstand</p>
<p>that?" "I do understand it. Now, Percival, come At once</p>
<p>to the point, And then I shall know what to</p>
<p>do. where is the danger of your position At the</p>
<p>present moment?" "Anne Catherick is in this neighbourhood, And in</p>
<p>communica- tion with Lady Glyde-there s the danger, plain enough.</p>
<p>who can read the letter she hid in the</p>
