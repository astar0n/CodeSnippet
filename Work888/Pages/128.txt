virtue-when I have the 335 chance of performing them. It
has been the misfortune of my life that I have
had few chances. My conception of friendship is sublime! Is
it my fault that your skeleton has peeped out At
me? why do I confess my curiosity? You poor superficial
Eng- lishman, it is to magnify my own self-control. I
Could draw your secret out of you, if I liked,

talk went on. "I showed you the letter to my
wife that Anne Catherick hid in the sand," Sir Percival
