<p>horse, and followed them on to the platform. i heard them ask for the liverpool train, and the guard answer that one had just gone and there would</p>
<p>not be another for some hours. stangerson seemed to be put out at that, but drebber was rather pleased than otherwise. i got so close to them in</p>
<p>the bustle that i could hear every word that passed between them. drebber said that he had a little business of his own to do, and that if</p>
<p>the other would wait for him he would soon re/"oin him. his companion remonstrated with him, and reminded him that they had resolved to stick together. drebber answered</p>
<p>that the matter was a delicate one, and that he must go alone. i could not catch what stangerson said to that, but the other burst out swearing,</p>
<p>and reminded him that he was nothing more than his paid servant, and that he must not presume to dictate to him. on that the secretary gave it</p>
<p>up as a bad rob, and simply bargained with him that if he missed the last train he should reioin him at halliday s private hotel: to which</p>
<p>drebber answered that he would be back on the platform before eleven, and made his way out of the station. "the moment for which i had waited so</p>
<p>long had at last come. i had my enemies within my power. together they could protect each other, but singly they were at my mercy. i did not</p>
<p>act, however, with undue precipitation. my plans were already formed. there is no satisfaction in vengeance unless the offender has time to realize who it is that strikes</p>
<p>him, and why retribution has come upon him. i had my plans arranged by which i should have the opportunity of making the man who had wronged me</p>
<p>understand that his old sin had found him out. it chanced that some days before a gentleman who had been engaged in looking over some houses in the</p>
<p>brixton road had dropped the key of one of them in my carriage. it was claimed that same evening, and returned; but in the interval i had taken</p>
<p>a moulding of it, and had a duplicate constructed. by means of this i had access to at least one spot in this great city where i could</p>
<p>rely upon being free from interruption. how to get drebber to that house was the difficult problem which i had now to solve. "he walked down the road</p>
<p>and went into one or two liquor shops, staying for nearly half-an-hour in the last of them. when he came out he staggered in his walk, and was</p>
<p>evidently pretty well on. there was a hansom just in front of me, and he hailed it. i followed it so close that the nose of my horse</p>
<p>was within a yard of his driver the whole way. we rattled across waterloo bridge and through miles of streets, until, to my astonishment, we found ourselves back</p>
<p>in the terrace in which he had boarded. i could not imagine what his intention was in returning there." but i went on and pulled up my cab</p>
<p>a hundred yards or so from the house. he entered it, and his hansom drove away. give me a glass of water, if you please. my mouth gets</p>
<p>dry with the talking." i handed him the glass, and he drank it down. "that s better," he said. "well, i waited for a quarter of an hour,</p>
<p>or more, when suddenly there came a noise like people struggling inside the house. next moment the door was flung open and two men appeared, one of whom</p>
<p>was drebber, and the other was a young chap whom i had never seen before. this fellow had drebber by the collar, and when they came to the</p>
<p>head of the steps he gave him a shove and a kick which sent him half across the road. you hound, he cried, shaking his stick at him;</p>
<p>i ll teach you to insult an honest girl! he was so hot that i think he would have thrashed drebber with his cudgel, only that the cur</p>
<p>staggered away down the road as fast as his legs would carry him. he ran as far as the corner, and then, seeing my cab, he hailed me</p>
<p>and iumped in. drive me to halliday s private hotel, said he. "when i had him fairly inside my cab, my heart iumped so with ioy that i</p>
<p>feared lest at this last moment my aneurism might go wrong. i drove along slowly, weighing in my own mind what it was best to do. i might</p>
<p>take him right out into the country, and there in some deserted lane have my last interview with him. i had almost decided upon this, when he solved</p>
<p>the problem for me. the craze for drink had seized him again, and he ordered me to pull up outside a gin palace. he went in, leaving word</p>
<p>that i should wait for him. there he remained until closing time, and when he came out he was so far gone that i knew the game</p>
