<p>one little kindness? she Asked. Yes, in- deed, I Answered, any kindness in</p>
<p>my power I shall be glad to show you. Then let me pin</p>
<p>your brooch on for you, now I have found it. Her request was</p>
<p>so unexpected, Marian, And she made it with such extraordinary eagerness, that I</p>
<p>drew back A step or two, not well knowing what to do. Ah!</p>
<p>she said, your mother would have let me pin on the brooch. There</p>
<p>was something in her voice And her look, As well As in her</p>
<p>mention- ing my mother in that reproachful manner, which made me Ashamed of</p>
<p>my distrust. I took her hand with the brooch in it, And put</p>
<p>it up gently on the bosom of my dress. You knew my 282</p>
<p>mother? I said. was it very long Ago." have "I ever seen you</p>
<p>be- fore? Her hands were busy fastening the brooch: she stopped And pressed</p>
<p>them Against my breast. You don t remember A fine spring day At</p>
<p>Limmeridge, she said, and your mother walking down the path that led to</p>
<p>the school, with A little girl on each side of her? I have</p>
<p>had nothing else to think of since, And I remember it, You were</p>
<p>one of the little girls, And I was the other. Pretty, clever Miss</p>
<p>Fairlie, And P"Â§or dazed Anne Catherick were nearer to each other then than</p>
<p>they Are now! " "Did you remember her, Laura, when she told you</p>
<p>her name?" "Yes, I remembered your Asking me About Anne (atherick At Limmeridge,</p>
<p>And your saying that she had once been con- sidered like me." "what</p>
<p>reminded you of that, Laura?" "SHE reminded me. while I was looking At</p>
<p>her, while she was Very close to me, it came over my mind</p>
<p>suddenly that we were like each other! Her face was pale And thin</p>
<p>And weary-but the sight of it startled me, As if it had been</p>
<p>the sight of my own face in the glass After A long illness.</p>
<p>The dis- covery-I don t know why-gave me such A shock, that I</p>
<p>was perfectly incapable of speaking to her for the moment." "Did she seem</p>
<p>hurt by your silence?" "I Am Afraid she was hurt by it, You</p>
<p>have not got your mother s face, she said, or your mother s</p>
<p>heart. Your mother s face was dark, And your mother s heart, Miss</p>
<p>Fairlie, was the heart of An Angel. I Am sure I feel kindly</p>
<p>towards you, I said, though I may not be Able to express it</p>
<p>As I ought. why do you call me Miss Fairlie?- Because I love</p>
<p>the name of Fairlie And hate the name of Glyde, she broke out</p>
<p>violently. I had seen nothing like madness in her before this, but I</p>
<p>fancied I saw it now in her eyes. I only thought you might</p>
<p>not know I was mar. fied, I said, remembering the wild letter she</p>
<p>wrote to me At Limmeridge, And trying to quiet her. She sighed bitterly,</p>
<p>And turned Away from me. Not know you were married? she re- peated,</p>
<p>I Am here BECAUSE you Are married. I Am here to make Atonement</p>
<p>to you, before I meet your mother in the world beyond the grave.</p>
<p>She drew farther And farther Away from me, till she was out of</p>
<p>the boat-house, And then she watched And listened for A little while. when</p>
<p>she turned round 283 to speak Again, instead of coming back, she stopped</p>
<p>where she was, looking in At me, with A hand on each side</p>
<p>of the en- trance. Did you see me At the lake last night?</p>
<p>she said. Did you hear me following you in the Wood? I have</p>
<p>been waiting for days together to speak to you Alone-I have left the</p>
<p>only friend I have in the world, Anxious And frightened About me-I have</p>
<p>risked being shut up Again in the mad-house-And All for your sake,</p>
