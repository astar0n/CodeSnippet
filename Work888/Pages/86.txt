<p>they could take ages. how about a brand-new healthy baby in just a few months? i d ask, some kind</p>
<p>of new fast track? the Question was always taken as a ioke. . . . i would be driving up</p>
<p>to quetzal manor in my old toyota, and i dearly wished steve could somehow materialize and be with me. in</p>
<p>his absence, however, i convinced lou to come along. i figured the change of scene would do him good, and</p>
<p>i also wanted the security of having him with me, after the threatening phone call to paula and the hispanic</p>
<p>thug who d accosted me outside her apartment building. besides, it d just be a couple of hours. the next</p>
<p>morning, as we trekked up riverside drive, then the henry hudson parkway, the sky was a flawless blue and the</p>
<p>wide hudson seemed like an ardent highway leading into the heart of america, still in elevated spirits over sarah s</p>
<p>momentary brush with consciousness, lou had noticeably less of a hangover than was usual most mornings. maybe he was looking</p>
<p>forward to a little mental r&r. for my own part, i felt my curiosity growing, i d gone to a</p>
<p>lot of appointments over the years, but rarely did i suspect the person i was going to see already knew</p>
<p>more about me than i knew about them. after we crossed the henry hudson bridge, we left the highway and</p>
<p>headed down a service road that led toward the river. then there was an imposing gate, open, and a tree-</p>
<p>shrouded driveway. finally the place loomed in front of us. the physical appearance of quetzal manor was a study in</p>
<p>european grandeur, translated with a few extra frills from the new world. carly had told me it had once been</p>
<p>a carmelite convent, dating from sometime in the middle of the last century, and it was a monument to church</p>
<p>authority, with endless arches of cut stone, turrets, gargoyles. as we were motoring to the end of the long cobblestone</p>
<p>drive, i felt as if i was approaching some gothic movie set, given its hovering sense of regal authority, the</p>
<p>place could easily have been a castle, but it seemed more like a brooding homage to medieval torture. let me</p>
<p>just say it was truly magis-terial, yet also more than a little creepy. as we parked under a huge oak</p>
<p>tree in front, i surveyed the facade, trying to marshal my strength. enough of my cold still lingered that i</p>
<p>didn t feel as if my mind was working on all cylinders, and for a moment i merely sat looking,</p>
<p>trying to breathe. "want me to go in with you?" lou asked finally. he was examining the building suspiciously, like</p>
<p>a detective surveying a crime scene. i wanted him with me and then again i didn t. i longed for</p>
<p>the company, a protector, but i didn t want the complications, more things to explain inside. finally i made a</p>
<p>snap decision. "why don t you take a stroll around the grounds?" i suggested. "commune with nature. the fresh air</p>
<p>will do you good. this can t take long. mainly i just want to get some literature and try to</p>
<p>gain a feeling for the place." that wasn t entirely, or even partly, true. what i really wanted to find</p>
<p>out was threefold: how did they manage to get beautiful healthy caucasian babies for two single women in just a</p>
<p>few months." how could those babies be only six months apart in age and still obviously be siblings; and (this</p>
<p>was where my feelings got complicated) could they get a baby for me the same way, never mind how they</p>
<p>did it. it was the third thing that actually bothered me the most, since i was far from sure i</p>
<p>wanted to be a part of whatever was going on. lou just shrugged and leaned back in his seat. "take</p>
<p>as long as you like. i ll just wait here in the car. i m not the nature type." that</p>
<p>was certainly the case. i walked across the cobblestones to an arched entryway that had no door. i wondered at</p>
<p>this-most convents are like a fortress-and then i realized the front door had been re-moved, leaving only its ancient hinges</p>
<p>still bolted into the stones. perhaps it was intended to be a symbol of openness, inviting you in. there was</p>
<p>no sign of anybody-the saccharine-voiced ramala was not on hand to greet me-so i just headed on down a wide</p>
<p>hallway, past a table of brochures. the place had been decorated with expensive good taste: tapestries all over the stone</p>
<p>walls, perfect persian rugs, classic church statuary-all of it calling forth powerful feelings from deep in the psyche, then i</p>
<p>entered a vast interior courtyard, where a central fountain splashed cheerily in the midday light. the courtyard was circled with</p>
<p>a picturesque gallery of cells, all with massive wooden doors, most likely rooms once inhabited by chaste sisters. the place</p>
<p>did seem to be a clinic-commune now, just as paula had said. not nuns this time around, but rather new</p>
<p>age acolytes whose tastes ran more to secular music than to religious chants, as witness the cacophony of sounds that</p>
<p>wafted out from several of the cells. only it wasn t any kind of conventional music; it seemed a mixture</p>
<p>of iapanese flute, north indian ragas, african drumming. i liked the ragas, even recognized my favorite, "bhairavi," then i spotted</p>
<p>something that riveted my attention. at the back of the courtyard, just past a final wooden door, stood a huge</p>
<p>south indian bronze statue, about five feet high, of the dancing shiva. it appeared to be presiding over the arch</p>
<p>way that led out into a dense natural garden behind the building. i walked across the cobblestones to examine and</p>
<p>admire it. it seemed an odd item to find here in the courtyard of a once-cloistered convent. i was so</p>
<p>enthralled i failed to hear the door behind me open. "do you find my shiva interesting, ms. iames." said</p>
