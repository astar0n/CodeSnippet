<p>companies operations to make sure they were managing their loans prudently. again, since the prospectus emphasized they were specialists in</p>
<p>overseas investment, i assumed that maybe part of the reason they were coming to the u.s. was to oversee the</p>
<p>fapanese companies doing business here with money borrowed from back home. nobody had actually told me this. in fact nobody</p>
<p>had told me anything. that was merely what i considered to be an educated guess. it was the only thing</p>
<p>i could think of that made the slightest sense. the following monday morning i told myself the guesswork was over.</p>
<p>it was high time i went up and saw for myself what they were doing. all i needed was an</p>
<p>excuse, then the phone rang. i was in the garden out back, skimming the times and working on a pot</p>
<p>of fresh coffee while waiting for the chicago exchanges to open. ben was cruising the fence line, sniffing for cats.</p>
<p>when i picked up the receiver, waiting at the other end was mr. yasuhiro tanaka, office manager for the new</p>
<p>york operation. he chatted a bit about the weather, how nice it was to be working in the u.s., the</p>
<p>usual, finally he mentioned that he needed to meet with me to discuss, among other matters, certain legal questions concerning</p>
<p>one of the other leases in their building. would it be convenient if he came down to my place and</p>
<p>we went over the paperwork? not necessary, i replied. i just happened to be headed for midtown in the next</p>
<p>few minutes. i d throw a copy of the leases into my briefcase and drop by to see him. then</p>
<p>before he could protest, i mumbled something about the doorbell and hung up. the phone rang again immediately, but i</p>
<p>didn t answer it. i was already putting on my iacket. i scribbled a few notes for emma, taped them</p>
<p>to her word processor, and headed out the door. minutes later i was in their third avenue lobby, greeting the</p>
<p>new security staff, several of whom, as a favor to tanaka, i d interviewed for their iobs. then i took</p>
<p>the elevator up to dni s offices on the eleventh floor and proceeded to have my argyle socks blown away.</p>
<p>first off, top security. the entryway just off the elevator bank had been completely transformed. tv intercom, steel doors-it could</p>
<p>have been the vault at chase. i told the camera s eye who i was and then waited while a</p>
<p>computer somewhere gave me a voice-id check. how they managed to have me in the system already i wasn t</p>
<p>exactly sure . . . maybe they d taken it off the phone? after i d cleared that, the doors</p>
<p>slid open and i entered the first chamber of a two-room security check. an electronic voice ordered me to put</p>
<p>my briefcase into the x-ray machine while i proceeded through the metal detector. that cleared, the set of steel panels</p>
<p>leading into the next room slid open and i went in . . . to be confronted by two crew-cut</p>
<p>guards who could have been retired sumo wrestlers. as the doors clicked behind me, i took one look at dni</p>
<p>s welcoming committee and realized they were packing uzis, those israeli automatics that could probably cut down a tree in</p>
<p>about two seconds. no candy-ass .38 s for dai nippon. without ceremony they commenced a body search. it was all</p>
<p>very polite, but it sure as hell wasn t perfunctory. i just stood there in astonishment while this gorilla roughly</p>
<p>twice my size felt me up. that indignity completed, i was now in line for the real surprise. yet another</p>
<p>set of steel doors opened, and there awaited the man i d been dealing with over the phone, yasuhiro tanaka.</p>
<p>medium build, late forties, cropped hair, automatic smile-he was noda s chief of operations for new york. he didn t</p>
<p>say much, just led me onto the floor, heading for his office. but he was clearly the on-site daimyo: lots</p>
<p>of heavy bowing from the young, white-shirted iapanese staff as we headed for the corner suite. which brings us to</p>
<p>the real shocker. dai nippon s floor operation looked like the flight deck of the starship enterprise. let me attempt</p>
<p>a brief description. in the far back was a massive nec augmented supercomputer-a half dozen off-white octagonal units about head</p>
<p>high, one the mainframe and the others storage modules arranged alongside in a neat row. pure power. the whole thing</p>
<p>was encased in a glassed room with ti assumed) critical temperature and humidity control. then out on the floor were</p>
<p>lines and lines of workstations. computer screens everywhere, printers running, stacks of color hard copy-pie charts, bar graphs, spreads-plus terminals</p>
<p>carrying every financial service offered by cable or satellite. this was /"ust the first, five-second glance. incredible, i thought. there</p>
<p>must be a heck of a lot more iapanese investment in the u.s. than anybody realizes. but something had to</p>
<p>be wrong here. why should . . . .I finally i slowed down-tanaka was hurrying me along, clearly annoyed that</p>
<p>i d appeared uninvited. that s when i noticed the rest. across one wall was a line of projection tvs,</p>
<p>on which computer data was being scrolled. as we walked past, i noticed that each screen seemed to be under</p>
<p>the scrutiny of a team of analysts, who were intently studying the numbers, comparing notes, running calculations on their individual</p>
<p>terminals. what s this all about? i stopped before one screen and studied it a second. beneath it a small</p>
<p>sign said simply "electronics." the one next to it read "biotechnology." then i glanced at a couple of others. each</p>
<p>one covered a different industrial sector. gee, i thought, you re really out of touch, walton. who would have guessed</p>
<p>fapan has so much investment in manufacturing here, i didn t remember much going on besides a few joint ventures.</p>
<p>sure, they ve got a few auto assembly plants, that steel plant they d bought out on the coast,</p>
