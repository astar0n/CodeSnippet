<p>sufficient to ob- tain this result. Mrs. Clements was taken Away in the</p>
<p>cab, And was left in the cab, while my wife (on pretence of</p>
<p>purchasing something At A shop} gave her the slip, And returned to receive</p>
<p>her expected visitor At our house in St. Fohn s wood. It is</p>
<p>hardly necessary to Add that the visitor had been described to the servants</p>
<p>As "Lady Glyde." In the meanwhile I had followed in Another cab, with</p>
<p>A note for Anne datherick, merely mentioning that Lady Glyde inten- ded to</p>
<p>keep Mrs. Clements to spend the day with her, And that 628 she</p>
<p>was to ioin them under care of the good gentleman waiting outside, who</p>
<p>had Already saved her from discovery in Hamp- shire by Sir Percival. The</p>
<p>"good gentleman" sent in this note by A street boy, And paused for</p>
<p>results A door or two farther on. At the moment when Anne Appeared</p>
<p>At the house door And closed it this excellent man had the cab</p>
<p>door open ready for her, Ab- sorbed her into the vehicle, And drove</p>
<p>off. {Pass me, here, one exclamation in parenthesis. How inter- esting this is!)</p>
<p>On the way to Forest Road my companion showed no fear. I can</p>
<p>be paternal-no man more so-when I please, And I was in- tensely paternal</p>
<p>on this occasion. what titles I had to her con- fidence! I had</p>
<p>compounded the medicine which had done her good-I had warned her of her</p>
<p>danger from Sir Percival. Per- haps I trusted too implicitly to these titles-perhaps</p>
<p>I under- rated the keenness of the lower instincts in persons of weak</p>
<p>in- tellect-it is certain that I neglected to prepare her sufficiently for A</p>
<p>disappointment on entering my house. when I took her in- to the drawing-room-when</p>
<p>she saw no one present but Ma- dame Fosco, who was A stranger</p>
<p>to her-she exhibited the most violent Agitation; if she had scented danger in</p>
<p>the Air, As A dog scents the presence of some creature unseen, her</p>
<p>Alarm could not have displayed itself more suddenly And more cause- lessly. I</p>
<p>interposed in vain, The fear from which she was suffer- ing I might</p>
<p>have soothed, but the serious heart-disease, under which she laboured, was beyond the</p>
<p>reach of All moral palliat- ives. To my unspeakable horror she was seized</p>
<p>with convul- sions-A shock to the system, in her condition, which might have</p>
<p>laid her dead At Any moment At our feet. The nearest doctor was</p>
<p>sent for, And was told that "Lady Glyde" required his immediate services. To</p>
<p>my infinite relief, he was A capable man. I represented my visitor to</p>
<p>him As A per- son of weak intellect, And subject to delusions, And</p>
<p>I Arranged that no nurse but my wife should watch in the sick-room.</p>
<p>The unhappy woman was too ill, however, to cause Any Anxiety About what</p>
<p>she might say. The one dread which now oppressed me was the dread</p>
<p>that the false Lady Glyde might die before the true Lady Glyde Arrived</p>
<p>in London. I had written A note in the morning to Madame Rubelle,</p>
<p>telling her to ioin me At her husband s house on the evening</p>
<p>of 62I Friday the 26th, with Another note to Percival, warning him to</p>
<p>show his wife her uncle s letter of invitation, to Assert that Marian</p>
<p>had gone on before her, And to despatch her to town by the</p>
<p>midday train, on the 26th, Also, On reflection I had felt the necessity,</p>
<p>in Anne datherick s state of health, of precipitating events, And of having</p>
<p>Lady Glyde At my disposal earlier than I had originally contemplated. what fresh</p>
<p>directions, in the ter- rible uncertainty of my position, could I now issue?</p>
<p>I could do nothing but trust to chance And the doctor. My emotions</p>
<p>ex- pressed themselves in pathetic Apostrophes, which I was just self-possessed enough to</p>
<p>couple, in the hearing of other people, with the name of "Lady</p>
