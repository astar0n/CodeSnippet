<p>throats or relieve the traumas they d just experienced. at length the miller party passed trough the doors only to</p>
<p>face a new spectacle. they found themselves in a huge room which brought back vivid memories of another party--a very</p>
<p>recent one. for they were surrounded by the same splendor they d seen in the great ballroom of the movie.</p>
<p>the rich, light colored wainscoted paneling was adorned with guilt baroque carvings. opulent chandeliers glittered and danced in their own</p>
<p>light. some felt a moment of uneasiness as they stepped into the opulent room. this quickly passed when they caught</p>
<p>sight of the refreshment tables, heavily laden with all sorts of gourmet delights. carved ice-statues stood guard over dishes of</p>
<p>lobster, crab, caviar. exotic cheeses and meats of all kinds caught both the eye and appetite of the crowd. it</p>
<p>was apparent to this sophisticated assembly they "were being treated to the best of food and attention. most were impressed.</p>
<p>in fact one congressman commented to roger bracken: "where on earth did they get all this? i haven t seen</p>
<p>such a lavish array of food since the inaugural over three years ago. must be black market." the legislator didn</p>
<p>t see the sharp look senator bracken gave him at his last remark. as the millers approached the table, a</p>
<p>voice called out: "oh, doctor---mrs. miller?" hurrying toward them as well as he could manage through the large crowd was</p>
<p>the movie buff. mr. amos parker. sharon who had been wearing a rather anxious expression, brightened when she saw him.</p>
<p>"mr. parker, i see you survived the ordeal," she laughed. "yes, my dear mrs. miller...although i must admit it was</p>
<p>a bit touch and go there for a while" he appeared a bit breathless from his struggle to reach them</p>
<p>and made an effort to catch his breath as he bubbled over with excitement. his eyes were shining with delight.</p>
<p>"but, have you ever seen such a movie?! i do think it was incredible--the most impressive filmever" his eyes! once</p>
<p>again kirk was stricken by the something unknown that lurked behind parker s eyes. the feeling was even stronger now</p>
<p>than the first time. perhaps it was the brightness of the ballroom lights or the weird experience they d just</p>
<p>been through. still, kirk felt there was more to this mr. parker than he wanted them to know. this troubled</p>
<p>kirk for a moment. he never suspected another human being without reason. there was something out of date about parker</p>
<p>s impeccable appearance. not just his tuxedo. there was also an old-fashioned sort of continental air about him. and the</p>
<p>way he spoke. one couldn t say it was actually shakespearian, but there was a lilt and cadence to his</p>
<p>phrasing that made one think of another age or culture. sharon and mr. parker were still enthusing about the movie.</p>
<p>suddenly their conversation stopped and they were looking at him. kirk realized he was expected to make some comment. he</p>
<p>felt awkward at moments like this. small talk was nearly impossible and he remained uncomfortable in the presence of the</p>
<p>urbane gentleman. "i...uh...the the film s concept is really amazing. part of my work deals with optics. the sophistication of</p>
<p>the production indicates an outstanding grasp of the medium. i would certainly like to see their equipment." "perhaps it can</p>
<p>be arranged, replied parker. "i m also rather curious about it." he turned his attention to sharon once more. they</p>
<p>excluded kirk and again began to toss about movie trivia as they had earlier. kirk smiled to himself. for such</p>
<p>an intelligent woman, sharon did en/"oy the simple thing of life. he looked at his watch. it was ten thirty--twenty-five</p>
<p>minutes since the start of the intermission, when would the movie resume? mrs, Jackson stood nearby, holding a conservative plate</p>
<p>of goodies and delicately trying everything. she d just dipped a cracker into a small sample of what looked like</p>
<p>black beads. she took a taste and made a wry face. kirk had been watching her with delight, and commented.</p>
<p>"caviar. it has an odd taste, doesn t it?" "it most certainly does," agreed the black woman with a smile.</p>
<p>"personally, ah prefer black-ahd peas. but the way things are nowadays, ah spect they re as spensive as this cayveear</p>
<p>and bout as rare. kirk laughed and nodded in agreement. henry iackson spied roger bracken in the crowd and pushed</p>
<p>his way though the throng to reach him. bracken was about to speak to john shipley when the black under</p>
<p>secretary ioined them. "senator bracken, excuse me, i m henry jackson, undersecretary to the secretary of agriculture." "well--ere, how do</p>
<p>you do---ah, henry?" roger bracken turned on his famous smile and extended his hand in a firm greeting. henry iackson</p>
<p>was so overwhelmed to be in the company of the famous senator from new york and the legendary senate maiority</p>
<p>leader, he failed to notice bracken s eyes were not smiling, in fact bracken resented the intrusion. half knowing the</p>
<p>reason for it, the younger senator was trying to think of a smooth way to delay their meeting. "henry, this</p>
<p>is senator john shipley of virginia. john, henry iackson." the southern senator returned iackson s handshake with genuine warmth. though</p>
<p>many southerners were still notoriously bigoted, he was not one of them. his whole philosophy of statesmanship was based on</p>
<p>the equality of men, regardless of color. iackson was flattered by the attention of two such powerful political leaders, but</p>
<p>then he remembered the reason for his being there and plunged right in. "senator bracken, the secretary sends his greetings</p>
<p>and regrets not being able to attend tonight. "yes, he missed quite a show. ah, i wonder--henry, i would like</p>
<p>to talk to you more about the department. perhaps we could get together after the movie tonight." henry iackson was</p>
<p>somewhat taken aback by this. he really wanted to deliver his message and then query the senator about an open</p>
<p>position to further his career. but not wishing to make any waves, he acquiesced and backed off. "of course</p>
