<p>incident on their hands. high level incident! laughed christopher, on the brink of hysteria. that s one way of looking</p>
<p>at it! try not to get wound up about it, amaryllis advised. you ll find there isn t room in</p>
<p>your brain to think about all that happened yesterday in one go. better to just accept that caroline s being</p>
<p>taken care of now, and that yesterday is in the past. so - you do trauma counselling as part of</p>
<p>your fob? said christopher. it s really a complete package, isn t it? i suppose filling in the funding application</p>
<p>is a kind of therapy? have you got a mole on the council as well? certainly not.-" said amaryllis sharply,</p>
<p>and then with a visible effort softened her tone, as if recalling that christopher was in a vulnerable state and</p>
<p>she should be gentle with him. no i lust believe in collaborating with people whose interests happen to coincide with</p>
<p>mine. wasn t that how we got into cahoots with stalin? said christopher lazily, getting up from the kitchen table</p>
<p>and moving through to the sitting-room, where he picked up an old copy of archives unlimited , his favourite light</p>
<p>reading. it wasn t until the following day that he had the energy to try and find out about amaryllis,</p>
<p>the glory days of the village hall, and the reason she had got stuck in the tunnel. the answers were</p>
<p>rather surprising. it s because of my father, she said simply. he lived in pitkirtly. years ago, of course. he</p>
<p>came here just before the war. christopher was taken aback. he had not imagined amaryllis would turn out to have</p>
<p>any scottish connections, although he had of course wondered what she was doing in such a small, relatively boring town</p>
<p>which might have seemed to someone from the south to be in the middle of nowhere. was he from around</p>
<p>here? he asked, afraid of pushing too hard. she hesitated, thought about it and said, not exactly.... he was a</p>
<p>refugee at first. a refugee? before the war? where from?... don t answer that if you d rather not. a</p>
<p>iewish refugee. from germany, she said, apparently reluctant to tell him. ah, said christopher, trying to sound sympathetic - not</p>
<p>that he didn t feel genuine sympathy for somebody who had had to leave their homeland and, presumably, some of</p>
<p>his friends and relations, behind and flee to a cold northerly climate where people might not necessarily be welcoming. and</p>
<p>he ended up in pitkirtly? yes... he settled down here and got married. then - she hesitated again, and christopher</p>
<p>held his breath. - he made lots of money and wanted to give something back to the town, she said</p>
<p>in a final rush, apparently embarrassed. that s good, said christopher, not really understanding. so - what did he give</p>
<p>back? he re-built the village hall, said amaryllis. ah, said christopher. something was becoming clearer, but he still couldn t</p>
<p>quite make out what sort of shape it had. the one in merchantman wynd. you know. the one - yes,</p>
<p>the one where you got stuck in the tunnel behind the cupboard under the sink, said christopher. the one we</p>
<p>went to see with steve paxman and the one he was in raptures over. the one that s almost a</p>
<p>ruin again but some people think can be restored to its former glory. i m sorry i didn t tell</p>
<p>you before, she said. the old hall was a ruin - worse than it is now - people had taken</p>
<p>away the stone to build houses so there was hardly anything left. what, did he make the tunnel too? having</p>
<p>previously been content to carry on not knowing anything about amaryllis, christopher now wanted to know everything. or at least,</p>
<p>everything that was relevant. he hadn t quite defined the word relevant in his own mind yet. no, the tunnel</p>
<p>used to belong to a gang of smugglers, said amaryllis, and smiled suddenly. my mother s family - they kept</p>
<p>the secret to themselves for a couple of centuries. it s been handed down through the family. so that s</p>
<p>why you were checking it out the other night, said christopher, and felt relieved that there hadn t been any</p>
<p>more sinister purpose behind her night-time excursion, lucky it didn t fall in on you, somebody s been looking after</p>
<p>it, she said, but didn t say who it was. perhaps the landlord of the elgin arms, he thought. he</p>
<p>could always have used it for storage as well - maybe he even kept up the tradition and stored things</p>
<p>he didn t want the vat man or the excise people to know about. pity they didn t keep it</p>
<p>free of spiders! said christopher. my father would have hated to see the hall the way it is now, said</p>
<p>amaryllis wistfully. he always said he d seen enough destruction for several lifetimes. he was still rather wary of this</p>
<p>new softer amaryllis, and would almost have preferred her to show her acerbic old self, at least occasionally. but no</p>
<p>doubt that one would come rushing back from vacation if the need arose. so, he said, what do you think</p>
<p>are the chances of the council paying for it to be restored? she frowned. not that great, to be honest.</p>
<p>it s a bit of a wreck. it was built in the early 50s when it was hard to get</p>
<p>good building materials. not like all those old victorian church halls and libraries, built from stone and built to last.</p>
<p>early 505? so, very nearly historic, then? it ll cost a fortune to restore, anyway, said amaryllis. i m not</p>
<p>even sure how much. i suppose part of the form is to do with getting estimates. quite a maior building</p>
<p>job, commented christopher. maybe in the big society Lye re meant to get together, rope in local builders and structural</p>
<p>engineers on a voluntary basis, and do it themselves, for the cost of the materials. but i can t</p>
