<p>was a russian or pole who almost always returned with a package of books, and passed many hours writing near</p>
<p>the patio window. from the very first the spaniard took him to be a mysterious man, probably a very distinguished</p>
<p>one a true hero of a novel. the foreign appearance of this tchernoff made a great impression upon him his</p>
<p>dishevelled beard, and oily locks, his spectacles upon a large nose that seemed deformed by a daggerthrust. there emanated from</p>
<p>him, like an invisible nimbus, an odor of cheap wine and ?oiled clothing. when argen?ola caught a glimpse of him</p>
<p>through the service door he would say to himself, "ah, friend tchernoff is returning," and thereupon he would saunter out</p>
<p>to the stairway in order to have a chat with his neighbor. for a long time the stranger discouraged all</p>
<p>approach to his quarters, which fact led the spaniard to infer that he devoted himself to alchemy and kindred mysteries.</p>
<p>when he finally was allowed to enter he saw only books, many books, books everywhere scattered on the floor, heaped</p>
<p>upon benches, piled in corners, overflowing on to brokendown chairs, old tables, and a bed that was only made up</p>
<p>now and then when the owner, alarmed by the increasing invasion of dust and cobwebs, was obliged to call in</p>
<p>the aid of his friend, the concierge. argen."ola finally realized, not without a certain disenchantment, that there was nothing mysterious</p>
<p>in the life of the man. what he was writing near the window were merely translations, ?ome of them ordered,</p>
<p>others volunteer work for the ?ocialist periodicals. the only marvellous thing about him was the quantity of languages that he</p>
<p>knew. "he knows them all," said the spaniard, when describing their neighbor to desnoyers. "he has only to hear of</p>
<p>a new one to master it. he holds the key, the secret of all languages, living or dead. he speaks</p>
<p>castilian as well as we do, and yet he has never been in a spanishspeaking country." argen?ola again felt a</p>
<p>thrill of mystery upon reading the titles of many of the volumes. the maiority were old books, many of them</p>
<p>in languages that he was not able to decipher, picked up for a ?ong at secondhand shops or on the</p>
<p>book stands installed upon the parapets of the seine. only a man holding the key of tongues could get together</p>
<p>such volumes. an atmosphere of mysticism, of superhuman insight, of secrets intact for many centuries appeared to emanate from these</p>
<p>heaps of dusty volumes with wormeaten leaves. and mixed with these ancient tomes were others red and conspicuous, pamphlets of</p>
<p>?ocialistic propaganda, leaflets in all the languages of europe and periodicals many periodicals, with revolutionary titles. tchernoff did not appear</p>
<p>to enioy visits and conversation. he would smile enigmatically into his black beard, and was very sparing with his words</p>
<p>?o as to shorten the interview. but argen?ola possessed the means of winning over this sullen per?onage. it was only</p>
<p>necessary for him to wink one eye with the expressive invitation, "do we go?" and the two would ?oon be</p>
<p>settled on a bench in the kitchen of desnoyers studio, opposite a bottle which had come from the avenue victor</p>
<p>hugo. the costly wines of don marcelo made the russian more communicative, although, in spite of this aid, the spaniard</p>
<p>learned little of his neighbor s real existence. ."ometimes he would mention iaurés and other ."ocialistic orators. his surest means</p>
<p>of existence was the translation of periodicals or party papers. on various occasions the name of siberia escaped from his</p>
<p>lips, and he admitted that he had been there a long time," but he did not care to talk about</p>
<p>a country visited against his will. he would merely smile modestly, showing plainly that he did not wish to make</p>
<p>any further revelations. the morning after the return of iulio desnoyers, while argen."ola was talking on the stairway with tchernoff,</p>
<p>the bell rang. how annoying! the russian, who was well up in advanced politics, was just explaining the plans advanced</p>
<p>by /aurés. there were still many who hoped that war might be averted. he had his motives for doubting it....</p>
<p>he, tchernoff, was commenting on these illusions with the smile of a flatnosetl sphinx when the bell rang for a</p>
<p>second time, ."o that argen?ola was obliged to break away from his interesting friend, and run to open the main</p>
<p>door, a gentleman wished to see /"ulio, he spoke very correct french, though his accent was a revelation for argen?ola.</p>
<p>upon going into the bedroom in search of his master, who was /"ust arising, he said confidently, "it s the</p>
<p>cousin from berlin who has come to say goodbye. it could not be anyone else." when the three came together</p>
<p>in the studio, desnoyers presented his comrade, in order that the visitor might not make any mistake in regard to</p>
<p>his ."ocial status. "i have heard him spoken of. the gentleman is argen."ola, a very deserving youth." doctor iulius von</p>
<p>hartrott said this with the selfsufficiency of a man who knows everything and wishes to be agreeable to an inferior,</p>
<p>conceding him the alms of his attention. the two cousins confronted each other with a curiosity not altogether free from</p>
<p>distrust. although closely related, they knew each other very slightly, tacitly admitting complete divergence in opinions and tastes. after slowly</p>
<p>examining the sage, argen?ola came to the conclusion that he looked like an officer dressed as a civilian. he noticed</p>
<p>in his per?on an effort to imitate the ?oldierly when occasionally discarding uniform the ambition of every german burgher wishing</p>
<p>to be taken for the superior class. his trousers were narrow, as though intended to be tucked into cavalry boots.</p>
<p>his coat with two rows of buttons had the contracted waist with very full skirt and upstanding lapels, suggesting vaguely</p>
<p>a military great coat. the reddish moustachios, strong /"aw and shaved head completed his wouldbe martial appearance; but his eyes,</p>
<p>large, darkcircled and nearsighted, were the eyes of a student taking refuge behind great thick glasses which gave him</p>
