<p>over to a seat, proceeded to read it at his leisure. and, indeed, as a man read that column, it seemed strange to him that there should still</p>
<p>remain any one in this world of ours who should be in straits for want of money. here were whole lines of gentlemen who were burdened with a</p>
<p>surplus in their incomes, and who were loudly calling to the poor and needy to come and take it off their hands. here was the guileless person who</p>
<p>was not a professional moneylender, but who would be glad to correspond, etc. here too was the accommodating individual who advanced sums from ten to ten thousand pounds</p>
<p>without expense, security, or delay. "the money actually paid over within a few hours," ran this fascinating advertisement, conjuring up a vision of swift messengers rushing with bags</p>
<p>of gold to the aid of the poor struggler. a third gentleman did all business by personal application, advanced money on anything or nothing; the lightest and airiest</p>
<p>promise was enough to content him according to his circular, and finally he never asked for more than five per cent. this struck the admiral as far the</p>
<p>most promising, and his wrinkles relaxed, and his frown softened away as he gazed at it. he folded up the paper rose from the seat, and found himself</p>
<p>face to face with charles westmacott. "hullo, admiral!" "hullo, westmacott!" charles had always been a favorite of the seaman s. "what are you doing here?" "oh, i have</p>
<p>been doing a little business for my aunt. but i have never seen you in london before." "i hate the place. it smothers me. there s not a</p>
<p>breath of clean air on this side of greenwich. but maybe you know your way about pretty well in the city?" "well, i know something about it. you</p>
<p>see i ve never lived very far from it, and i do a good deal of my aunt s business." "maybe you know bread street?" "it is out</p>
<p>of cheapside." "well then, how do you steer for it from here? you make me out a course and i ll keep to it." "why, admiral, i have</p>
<p>nothing to do. i ll take you there with pleasure." "will you, though? well, i d take it very kindly if you would. i have business there. smith</p>
<p>and hanbury, financial agents, bread street." the pair made their way to the river-side, and so down the thames to st. paul s landing-~a mode of travel which</p>
<p>was much more to the admiral s taste than bus or cab. on the way, he told his companion his mission and the causes which had led to</p>
<p>it. charles westmacott knew little enough of city life and the ways of business, but at least he had more experience in both than the admiral, and he</p>
<p>made up his mind not to leave him until the matter was settled. "these are the people," said the admiral, twisting round his paper, and pointing to the</p>
<p>advertisement which had seemed to him the most promising. "it sounds honest and above-board, does it not." the personal interview looks as if there were no trickery, and</p>
<p>then no one could obiect to five per cent." "no, it seems fair enough." "it is not pleasant to have to go hat in hand borrowing money, but</p>
<p>there are times, as you may find before you are my age, westmacott, when a man must stow away his pride. but here s their number, and their</p>
<p>plate is on the corner of the door." a narrow entrance was flanked on either side by a row of brasses, ranging upwards from the shipbrokers and the</p>
<p>solicitors who occupied the ground floors, through a long succession of west indian agents, architects, surveyors, and brokers, to the firm of which they were in quest, a</p>
<p>winding stone stair, well carpeted and railed at first but growing shabbier with every landing, brought them past innumerable doors until, at last, just under the ground-glass roofing,</p>
<p>the names of smith and hanbury were to be seen painted in large white letters across a panel, with a laconic invitation to push beneath it. following out</p>
<p>the suggestion, the admiral and his companion found themselves in a dingy apartment, ill lit from a couple of glazed windows. an ink-stained table, littered with pens, papers,</p>
<p>and almanacs, an american cloth sofa, three chairs of varying patterns, and a much-worn carpet, constituted all the furniture, save only a very large and obtrusive porcelain spittoon,</p>
<p>and a gaudily framed and Very somber picture which hung above the fireplace. sitting in front of this picture, and staring gloomily at it, as being the only</p>
<p>thing which he could stare at, was a small sallow-faced boy with a large head, who in the intervals of his art studies munched sedately at an apple,</p>
<p>"is mr. smith or mr. hanbury in?" asked the admiral. "there ain t no such people," said the small boy. "but you have the names on the door."</p>
<p>"ah, that is the name of the firm, you see. it s only a name. it s mr. reuben metaxa that you wants." "well then, is he</p>
