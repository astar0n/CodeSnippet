<p>the help, the enioyments, the comforts,and the pleasures of Haurvatat. we unite them with him who would come up to</p>
<p>thee as one of the Amesha-Spentas, as he would come to any of the Amesha-Spentas, Vohu-Mano, Asha-Vahishta,i<1hshathra-Vairya, Spenta-Armaiti, Haurvatat, and</p>
<p>Ameretat. 2 He who against the thousands of thousands of those Daevas, against their ten thousands of ten thousands, against</p>
<p>their numberless myriads would invoke the name of Haurvatat, as one of the Amesha-Spentas, he would smite the Nasu, he</p>
<p>would smite Hashi he would smite Bashi, he would smite Saeni, he would smite Buii. 3 I proclaim the faithful</p>
<p>man as the first [of men]; if I proclaim the faithful man as the first [of men], then Rashnu Razishta,</p>
<p>then every heavenly Yazata of male nature in company with the Amesha-Spentas will free the faithful man 4 From the</p>
<p>Nasu, from Hashi, from Gashi, from Saeni, from Buii; from the hordes with the wide front, from the hordes with</p>
<p>the many spears uplifted, from the evil man who oppresses, from the willful sinner, from the oppressor of men, from</p>
<p>the Yatu,from the Pairika, from the straying way. 5 How does the way of the faithful turn and part from</p>
<p>the way of the wicked? Ahura Mazda answered: It is when a man pronouncing my spell, either reading or reciting</p>
<p>it by heart, draws the furrows and hides there himself, [Sa.VitIe]-" 6 "I will smite thee, O Drui-" whomsoever thou</p>
<p>art, whomsoever thou art amongst the Dru/"es that come in an open way, whomsoever thou art amongst the Dru/"es that</p>
<p>come by hidden way, whomsoever thou art amongst the Dru/"es that defile by contact; whatsoever Dru/" thou 13 ? Awerdad</p>

<p>the faithful; he draws six furrow: I proclaim him one of the faithful; he draws nine furrows: I proclaim him</p>
<p>one of thefaithful. 8 The names of those (Amesha-Spentas) smite the men turned to Nasus by the Dru/"es: the seed</p>
<p>and kin of the deaf are smitten,the scornful are dead, as the Zaotar Zarathushtra blows them away to woe, however</p>
<p>fierce, at his will and wish, as many as he wishes. .I From the time when the sun is down</p>
<p>he smites them with bruising blows; from the time when the sun is no longer up, he deals deadly blows</p>
<p>on the Nasu with his club struck down, for the propitiation and glorification of the heavenly gods. 10 O Zarathushtra!</p>
<p>let not that spell be shown to any one,except by the father to his son, or by the brother to</p>
<p>his brother from the same womb, or by the Athravan to his pupil in blackhair, devoted to the good law,</p>
<p>who, devoted to the good law, holy and brave, stills all the Druies. 11 For his brightness and glory, I</p>
<p>will offer unto him a sacrifice worth being heard, namely, unto /-iaurvatat, the Amesha-Spenta. Unto Haurvatat, the Amesha-Spenta, we offer</p>
<p>up the libations, the Haoma and meat, the baresma, the wisdom of the tongue, the holy spells, the speech, the</p>
