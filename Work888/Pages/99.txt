<p>when ms. faye finally walked in on this invisible man and scared him off, she reports that he was a</p>
<p>gray haired old man who proceeded to iump out the third floor window and take off running. does anyone here</p>
<p>share my frustration? any comments of explanation? okay, answer me this, were there any classified sites this individual was not</p>
<p>able to get into right under our noses?" markman s overdue visit to the university brought interesting, though unsettling, news.</p>
<p>the second floor security office, usually buzzing with activity, was nearly deserted. a dispassionate secretary directed him to meeting room</p>
<p>201. "i don t have anything to do today. i hate cable television. i already called back to florida twice.</p>
<p>they won t let me into my grandfather s apartment until after the burial. ?o, if you don t mind,</p>
<p>i ll come and hang out with you for a while." i stopped and turned to him. "you heard what</p>
<p>mark said." "yes. and it might not hurt to have ?omeone else keeping an eye open tonight, don t you</p>
<p>think?" he gave a little half shrug. "let me do this. let me have ?omething to do ?o i m</p>
<p>not sitting in my room waiting for iunior to show up again," "i wouldn t mind the company for a</p>
<p>while," i admitted. mark s news had spooked me, though i wouldn t say ?o aloud. "but you don t</p>
<p>have to stay all night." "fair enough." my cousin scott barely grunted goodbye when i took over. yeah, it s</p>
<p>mostly family running the shop. i keyed the register over to me, took care of a customer scott had abandoned</p>
<p>in his haste to get away, and then grabbed a chair out of the back room ?o derrick could sit</p>
<p>while we talked. derrick turned out to be nice company. we talked about high school, though i steered clear of</p>
<p>anything touching on the trouble he d always been in. "?o, are many of the class still around?" he asked.</p>
<p>"reba is," i answered with a bit of a snarl. he winced and i remembered, too late, how the two</p>
<p>of them had been hot and heavy and in a lot of trouble for sneaking off together when they should</p>
<p>have been in class. "she s married now and has three kids," i offered. "oh. good. good for her, i</p>
<p>mean. glad she found ?omeone." good reaction. he might even have blushed. i smiled, until i heard the ?ound of</p>
<p>a distant car "/unior s on his way," i warned. "you should get out of sight. damn. customer in the</p>
<p>wash room already " "how the hell can you tell iunior oh. for a second i thought you were psychic."</p>
<p>he glanced toward the gas pumps, but only a white subaru sat under the awning. "he might be heading ?omewhere</p>
<p>else " "he always stops here on his way home from work to buy his nightly twelve pack." "figures. i</p>
<p>ll stick with you. i don t want to run and hide every time one of the westons show up."</p>
<p>"derrick " "if he gets rowdy again, we ll go outside. he might be smart. you have a video camera</p>
<p>going and he s paranoid about those things." "doesn t stop him from making passes at me." "i m surprised</p>
<p>sally married him and has stuck around." ?o, he knew a little bit about what went on with the westons.</p>
<p>that surprised me. the truck pulled up in front of the door, the muffler ?o loud the ?ound shook the</p>
<p>windows when he revved the engine. the dogs paced around in the back, drenched and unhappy. he took them to</p>
<p>work at the junk yard over in crawford most days. ?ometimes they came back with torn ears and limps another</p>
<p>rea?on we thought he had a dog fighting ring, though the cops hadn t been able to track down the</p>
<p>place. i knew they tried, though. no one liked the westons much. today, three of the dogs leapt out of</p>
<p>the back and yapped and growled as he swaggered up to the door, covered in grease and mud and god</p>
<p>knew what else. he always acted like i should find it swiney. "thank god i m not related to the</p>
<p>westons," derrick suddenly said and made me grin, despite the situation. iunior came inside, yelling obscenities at the dogs. the</p>
<p>dogs bounced against the door after he came through, leaving long muddy streaks, which annoyed me more. iunior spotted derrick.</p>
<p>i started to back away, even with the counter between me and him. i d never want to see anyone</p>
<p>turn such anger on me, and i dared a glance at derrick. he d kept his place, and the placid</p>
<p>look on his face must have annoyed iunior all the more. he took four stomping steps closer, his hands in</p>
<p>fists at his side. "oh, no. i figured you would come ?ometime because i am such a seductive, svelte, and</p>
<p>slender woman that you could not resist for very long." she hid her face in his shoulder ?o he would</p>
<p>not hear nor see her giggles. rick placed a hand on her firm butt and drew her as close as</p>
<p>they could get in that position. "you re fibbing to me. you were having a hissy waiting for me to</p>
<p>get here to hold you, kiss you and make you feel like i m seducing you." "my lover, you have</p>
<p>already seduced me. at least metaphorically." "oh iesus, an english ma/"or. seductive, svelte and throw in metaphorically." "did you like</p>
<p>that? i have more time again in my life to study. you have adjusted my head to make me ?o,</p>
<p>neh?" "i want to lay on you, but i cannot." "another christmas present?" "no. a pre-christmas present on about the</p>
<p>twelfth or thirteenth of december. in the meantime we will have to settle for nestling together with my backside against</p>
<p>your belly. now, dinner. help me up and i ll fix it for us." "we will fix it. i</p>
