<p>bride and groom were standing together now, and they began to circle the fire while the women standing nearby sang</p>
<p>a monotonous, repetitive song. hawksworth counted seven turns of the fire. then they seated themselves and the priest placed a</p>
<p>red dot on the forehead of man and wife. "they ll feast tonight, and then the groom will return to</p>
<p>his village." vasant rao spurred his mount to catch up with the caravan. "later she and her family will go</p>
<p>there for more ceremonies. after that the groom may not see her again for several years, until the day her</p>
<p>father decides she s ready for the gauna, the consummation of the marriage. i didn t see my bride again</p>
<p>for two years." "what happened then?" "she came to my village for a few days and stayed in the women</p>
<p>s quarters-the men and women sleep apart in these villages-and i had to go there and try to find her</p>
<p>cot. after that she went back home and it was several months later before i saw her again. then she</p>
<p>came back, for a longer time. finally she moved to my village, but by then i was nineteen and soon</p>
<p>after i left on a campaign. she stayed with my younger brother while i was gone, and when i returned,</p>
<p>she was with child. who can say whether it was mine or his? but none of it matters, for she</p>
<p>died in childbirth." he spurred his horse past the line of carts. "let s try to make the river before</p>
<p>sundown." hawksworth couldn t believe what he had heard, and he whipped his mount to catch up. "your brother kept</p>
<p>your wife while you were away?" "of course. i don t know how it is here, but in the part</p>
<p>of india where i was born, brothers normally share each other s wives. i used to go to my older</p>
<p>brother s house when he was gone and visit his wife. she expected it and would have been upset if</p>
<p>i hadn t come to her." vasant rao was puzzled by hawksworth s surprise. "don t brothers share one another</p>
<p>s wives in england?" "well, not. . . usually. i mean . . . no. hell no. it s damned</p>
<p>close to incest. the truth is a husband would have grounds to Call out a man he caught with his</p>
<p>wife. and especially a brother." " call him out, captain? what does that mean?" "a duel. with swords. or maybe</p>
<p>pistols." vasant rao was incredulous. "but what if a man goes away on a Campaign? his wife will grow frustrated.</p>
<p>hindus believe a woman has seven times the sexual energy of a man. she would start meeting other men in</p>
<p>the village if a man didn t have a brother to keep her satisfied. in the village where i grew</p>
<p>up, if a man and woman met together by chance in the forest, and they had the same caste, we</p>
<p>all assumed they would make the most of the opportunity. so it s better for the honor of the family</p>
<p>if your brothers care for your wife. it s an important duty for brothers. and besides, as long as a</p>
<p>woman attends to her own husband s needs, what does it matter if his brother enioys her also?" hawksworth found</p>
<p>himself astonished. "how does . . . i mean, what about this brother s own wife? what does she think</p>
<p>about all this?" "if her husband wants to visit his brothers wives, what should she care? it s normal, she</p>
<p>ll also find ways to meet her husband s brothers for the same purpose. women married to brothers often try</p>
<p>to send each other away on errands, in order to en/"oy the other s husband. so wives have no reason</p>
<p>to complain. in fact, if a woman returns to her own village for a visit, she will probably seek out</p>
<p>some of the men she knew when she was young and en/"oy them, since her husband is not around and</p>
<p>no one in her own village would tell him. hindus in the villages don t lock away their women the</p>
<p>way the muslims do, captain hawksworth, and because they re free to enjoy whoever they wish, they aren t frustrated</p>
<p>and unhappy the way muslim women are. surely your england is an advanced country where women have the same freedom."</p>
<p>hawksworth puzzled for a minute before trying to answer. the truth is there s a big difference between what s</p>
<p>said and what s done. with chastity praised from the pulpits and whores the length of london. and highborn ladies</p>
<p>thronging the playhouses, ready to cuckold their husbands with any cavalier who ll give them a look. how can i</p>
<p>explain it? "i guess you d say upper-class women have the most freedom to take lovers. usually young gallants or</p>
<p>soldiers, and no one is surprised if her husband makes full use of his serving wench," "are these soldiers and</p>
<p>serving women from a lower caste?" "well, we don t exactly have . . ." hawksworth paused for a moment.</p>
<p>"actually i guess you could say they re a lower caste, in a way." vasant reined in his mount and</p>
<p>inspected hawksworth for a moment in disgust. "please excuse me if i say yours must be a very immoral country.</p>
<p>captain. such a thing would never happen in india. no raiput would touch the body of a low caste. it</p>
<p>would be pollution." "you don t care what your women do? all that matters is who they do it with?"</p>
<p>hawksworth suddenly realized he found it all too absurd to believe. it sounds like another tale of the indies. concocted</p>
<p>to entertain credulous seamen. "all right, then, what about your own wife? did she have other men besides your brothers?"</p>
<p>"how would i know?" vasant rao waved his hand, dismissing the question as insignificant, "i suppose it s possible. but</p>
<p>after she died i decided i d had enough of wives and women. i took a vow of chastity.</p>
