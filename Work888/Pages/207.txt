<p>how dwelleth the love of God in him .I My little children, let us not love in word, neither in</p>
<p>tongue ." but in deed and in truth. And hereby we know that we are of the truth, and shall</p>
<p>assure our hearts before him. For if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and knoweth all</p>
<p>things. Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, then have we confidence toward God. 8 I 10 11 12 13</p>
<p>14 15 16 1I 18 1I 20 21 2604 1 tone 4 And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him,</p>
<p>because we keep his commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in his sight. And this is his commandment,</p>
<p>That we should believe on the name of his Son ﬂesus Christ, and love one another, as he gave us</p>
<p>commandment. And he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him, and he in him. And hereby we know that he</p>
<p>abideth in us, by the Spirit which he hath given us. 4 The Spirit of God and the Spirit of</p>
<p>Antichrist 8eloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God : because many false prophets</p>
<p>are gone out into the world. Hereby jcnow ye the Spirit of God ." Every spirit that confesseth that Fesus</p>
<p>Christ is come in the flesh is of God : and every spirit that confesseth not that ﬂesus Christ is</p>
<p>come in the flesh is not of God ." and this is that spirit of antichrist, whereof ye have heard</p>
<p>that it should come I and even now already is it in the world. Ye are of God, little children,</p>
<p>and have overcome them : because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world.</p>
<p>They are of the world : therefore speak they of the world, and the world heareth them. we are of</p>
<p>God : he that knoweth God heareth us ; he that is not of God heareth not us. Hereby know</p>
<p>we the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error. God "is Love Beloved, let us love one another :</p>
<p>for love is of God ," and every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God. He that</p>
<p>loveth not, knoweth not God I for God is love. 22 23 24 1 2 3 4 5 6 I</p>
<p>8 2605 1 tlohn 5 "in this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent his</p>
<p>only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him. Herein is love, not that we loved God,</p>
<p>but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins. 8eloved, if God so</p>
<p>loved us, we ought also to love one another. No man hath seen God at any time. If we love</p>
<p>one another, God dwelleth in us, and his love is perfected in us. Hereby know we that we dwell in</p>
<p>him, and he in us, because he hath given us of his Spirit. And we have seen and do testify</p>
<p>that the Father sent the Son to be the Saviour of the world. whosoever shall confess that ﬁesus is the</p>
<p>Son of God, God dwelleth in him, and he in God. And we have known and believed the love that</p>
<p>God hath to us. God is love ," and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in</p>
<p>him. Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment : because as</p>
<p>he is, so are we in this world. There is no fear in love ; but perfect love casteth out</p>
<p>fear ." because fear hath torment. He that feareth is not made perfect in love. we love him, because he</p>
<p>first loved us. I!" a man say, "I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar ." for</p>
<p>he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen</p>
<p>? And this commandment have we from him, That he who loveth God love his brother also. 5 Faith I5</p>
<p>the Victory over the world whosoever believeth that iesus is the Christ is born of God ." and every one</p>
<p>that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is begotten of him. I 10 11 12 13 14 15</p>
<p>16 1I 18 1I 20 21 1 2606 1 ﬂohn 5 By this we know that we love the children</p>
<p>of God, when we love God, and keep his commandments. For this is the love of God, that we keep</p>
<p>his commandments : and his commandments are not grievous. For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world : and</p>
<p>this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith. who is he that overcometh the world, but he</p>
<p>that believeth that iesus is the Son of God .I The witness concerning the Son This is he that came</p>
<p>by water and blood, even ﬂesus Christ ; not by water only, but by water and blood. And it is</p>
<p>the Spirit that beareth witness, because the Spirit is truth. For there are three that bear record in heaven, the</p>
<p>Father, the word, and the Holy Ghost : and these three are one. And there are three that bear witness</p>
<p>in earth, the spirit, and the water, and the blood : and these three agree in one. If we receive</p>
<p>the witness of men, the witness of God is greater ." for this is the witness of God which he</p>
<p>hath testified of his Son. He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself : he</p>
<p>that believeth not God hath made him a liar ; because he believeth not the record that God gave of</p>
<p>his Son. And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in</p>
<p>his Son. He that hath the Son hath life ." and he that hath not the Son of God hath</p>
<p>not life, The Knowledge of Eternal Life These things have "I written unto you that believe on the name of</p>
<p>the Son of God I that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe on</p>
<p>the name of the Son of God. And this is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we</p>
<p>ask any thing according to his will, he heareth us : 2 3 4 5 6 I 8 I 10</p>
