<p>watch-chain. Philip thought the other girls looked from him to the pair at</p>
<p>the table and exchanged significant glances. He felt certain they were laughing at</p>
<p>him, and his blood boiled. He detested Mildred now with all his heart.</p>
<p>He knew that the 551 of 1241 Of Human 8ondage best thing he</p>
<p>could do was to cease coming to the tea- shop, but he could</p>
<p>not bear to think that he had been worsted in the affair, and</p>
<p>he devised a plan to show her that he despised her. Next day</p>
<p>he sat down at another table and ordered his tea from another waitress.</p>
<p>Mildred s friend was there again and she was talking to him. She</p>
<p>paid no attention to Philip, and so when he went out he chose</p>
<p>a moment when she had to cross his path: as he passed he</p>
<p>looked at her as though he had never seen her before. He repeated</p>
<p>this for three or four days. He expected that presently she would take</p>
<p>the opportunity to say something to him; he thought she would ask why</p>
<p>he never came to one of her tables now, and he had prepared</p>
<p>an answer charged with all the loathing he felt for her. He knew</p>
<p>it was absurd to trouble, but he could not help himself. She had</p>
<p>beaten him again. The German suddenly disappeared, but Philip still sat at other</p>
<p>tables. She paid no attention to him. Suddenly he realised that what he</p>
<p>did was a matter of complete indifference to her; he could go on</p>
<p>in that way till doomsday, and it would have no effect. I ve</p>
<p>not finished yet, he said to himself. The day after he sat down</p>
<p>in his old seat, and when she came up said good-evening as though</p>
<p>he had not ignored her for a week. His face was placid, but</p>
<p>he could not 552 of 1241 Of Human Bondage prevent the mad beating</p>
<p>of his heart. At that time the musical comedy had lately leaped into</p>
<p>public favour, and he was sure that Mildred would be delighted to go</p>
<p>to one. I say, he said suddenly, I wonder if you d dine</p>
<p>with me one night and come to The 8elle of New York. I</p>
<p>ll get a couple of stalls. He added the last sentence in order</p>
<p>to tempt her. He knew that when the girls went to the play</p>
<p>it was either in the pit, or, if some man took them, seldom</p>
<p>to more expensive seats than the upper circle. Mildred s pale face showed</p>
<p>no change of expression. I don t mind, she said. when will you</p>
<p>come? I get off early on Thursdays. They made arrangements. Mildred lived with</p>
<p>an aunt at Herne Hill. The play began at eight so they must</p>
<p>dine at seven. She proposed that he should meet her in the second-class</p>
<p>waiting-room at Victoria Station. She showed no pleasure, but accepted the invitation as</p>
<p>though she conferred a favour. Philip was vaguely irritated. 553 of I24I Of</p>
<p>Human Bondage LVII Philip arrived at Victoria Station nearly half an hour before</p>
<p>the time which Mildred had appointed, and sat down in the second-class waiting-room.</p>
<p>He waited and she did not come. He began to grow anxious, and</p>
<p>walked into the station watching the incoming suburban trains; the hour which she</p>
<p>had fixed passed, and still there was no sign of her. Philip was</p>
<p>impatient. He went into the other waiting-rooms and looked at the people sitting</p>
<p>in them. Suddenly his heart gave a great thud. There you are. I</p>
<p>thought you were never coming. I like that after keeping me waiting all</p>
<p>this time. I had half a mind to go back home again. But</p>
<p>you said you d come to the second-class waiting- room. I didn t</p>
<p>say any such thing. It isn t exactly likely I d sit in</p>
<p>the second-class room when I could sit in the first is it?</p>
