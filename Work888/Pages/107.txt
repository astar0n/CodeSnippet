<p>twisted into a half smile. now tell me, what s this love feast we re supposed to be having tonight?"</p>
<p>"it s a custom we have once a week in which our whole community has a meal and fellowship together.</p>
<p>it apparently used to be an old christian custom." "oh, yes," harry sighed, "i should have remembered. tertullian wrote about</p>
<p>it, didn t he?" "tertullian? oh, yes, i guess so. but it s also mentioned in the bible in -"</p>
<p>"yes, i know, in the epistle of /"ude." i nodded, surprised that he knew the bible so well. "you know,</p>
<p>tonight we ll be officially welcoming you into our community." he rolled his eyes. "not if i wake up first!"</p>
<p>i chuckled, then asked, "so what do you think of our fellowship hall?" he gazed around, noticing the polished parquet</p>
<p>floor, large windows, and cathedral ceiling decorated with frescos of people, animals, birds, trees, and the divine light. then slowly,</p>
<p>he nodded his head in approval. "well, it s not exactly the sistine chapel, but nonetheless, quite impressive, i must</p>
<p>admit, at least in a sort of rustic way." he then smiled as he added, "of course, the dream symbolisms,</p>
<p>with all these frescoes of nature, are again all too obvious." "if you like it now, just wait for tonight</p>
<p>when this whole place becomes alive. there s even going to be music performed there on the stage," i sald,</p>
<p>hoping to create an air of excitement and anticipation. noticing the piano on the platform, he asked, "and i suppose</p>
<p>the music will be played by you on that rather odd looking piano?" "no, probably by somebody else. there are</p>
<p>two ladies that play reasonably well, as well as somebody who can play the violin not too badly, and another</p>
<p>the flute. carlos, who you just met, can also strum the guitar." "what do they play? your church music?" "yes,</p>
<p>that s what basically they mostly play, i suppose." "what about you? you re classically trained? and you sald you</p>
<p>can also play the piano." "yes, but certainly not up to concert standard. also, the only classical piano music pieces</p>
<p>i had a chance to play since my resurrection were schumann s the happy farmer, a couple of schubert waltzes,</p>
<p>and beethoven s fur elise." he flashed a smiled. "then please be so good as to perform." i nodded somewhat</p>
<p>reluctantly and played a less than perfect rendition of beethoven s famous piano piece. by the look on his face,</p>
<p>he clearly saw the mistakes i had made, particularly on the demisemiquavers. yet, i simply laughed it off. "i tried</p>
<p>to tell you, harry, that i m very rusty, as you can see." however, he simply nodded and then commenced</p>
<p>scribbling. at first, i thought he was writing about my performance, as if he was some music examiner at the</p>
<p>conservatorium. however, upon getting up from the stool, i realized he was writing about the fellowship hall. he then started</p>
<p>writing about deer park village and its inhabitants, including the conversations we had so far, much of it verbatim. he</p>
<p>filled the entire first page, then a second, then even a third, amazing me with his prodigious memory. finally, he</p>
<p>looked up and asked, "so what other wonders am i going to be shown?" "what about our hall of worship?"</p>
<p>i asked. a wry smile appeared. "ah, the hall of worship. of course. yes, why not?" again, he only seemed</p>
<p>to be moderately impressed, although it was by far our most impressive building "ln deer park. to get there, we</p>
<p>had to walk to the south-eastern edge of our village, and there on a hill, nestled amongst the pines, near</p>
<p>the foot of anastasis, our place of worship sparkled like a iewel. "certainly this isn t of timber construction. is</p>
<p>it made from some sort of glass?" "no, actually from highly polished wood." "that s impossible!" he declared. "no wood</p>
<p>could be that reflective." he sniggered and then shook his head. "ah, i keep forgetting that this is only just</p>
<p>a dream." upon entering, he gazed up at the cathedral-type ceiling and studied the frescoes. "yes, quite impressive, but, of</p>
<p>course, they don t compare to the frescoes of michelangelo." noticing then the glassless windows, crisscrossed with delicate carved wooden</p>
<p>lace, he added, "how quaint. however, why not use real stained-glass windows. it would have been more effective." he then</p>
<p>pitifully shook his head. "however, even then, it still would not even compare to new york s cathedral of saint</p>
<p>john the divine," oh, brother, what a snob! i thought. i seemingly liked him better as a neurotic. however, i</p>
<p>only politely smiled at his condescension. "it s of course empty now, but on our seventh day, we pack our</p>
<p>hall with more than three hundred people from our village and surrounding areas." he then noticed the piano, again very</p>
<p>similar to the other one in the fellowship hall. "and i suppose during these occasions somebody will be playing hymns?</p>
<p>but why on a piano? why not on a pipe organ? it would sound so much grander." we walked towards</p>
<p>it and he lifted up its cover and tapped a few keys. "so, could you at least provide me with</p>
<p>an example of a hymn? i presume they are not the standard hymns one hears, but are compositions from your</p>
<p>religion." "yes, that s right. would you like me to play one for you?" he nodded and thus i again</p>
<p>sat myself on a piano stool and played we thank you our god. it was a simple piece that i</p>
<p>had easily learnt over the last two weeks or so. upon completion i chuckled and added, "it sounds better when</p>
<p>the congregation sings along." he sniggered. "yes, of course." he then stared around our worship hall before walking up towards</p>
<p>the platform. on the lectern he saw a closed book. he opened it and was surprised to see that it</p>
<p>was not the bible. "what is this?" he asked. "it s what we call the paradise text. " "the</p>
