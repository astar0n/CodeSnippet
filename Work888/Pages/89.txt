<p>movements of half-nomad populations. This instability of boundaries led to ethnic cleansing, to numerous international congresses, to fitful wars, "in an effort</p>
<p>to justify a distinct existence and identity, thousands of "scholars" embarked on Herculean efforts of inventing histories for their newly emergent nations,</p>
<p>"inevitably, these histories conflicted and led to yet more bloodshed. A land fertilized by blood produces harvests of bloated corpses. In the</p>
<p>Balkans people fight for their very own identity. They aspire to purity, albeit racial, and to boundaries, albeit of the abstract kind.</p>
<p>It is, perhaps, the kernel of this Greek tragedy: that real people are sacrificing real people on the altar of the abstract.</p>
<p>It is a battle of tastes, a clash of preferences, an Armageddon of opinions, judgements, lessons, Armies are still moved by ancient</p>
<p>events, by symbols, by fiery speeches, by abstract, diffuse notions. "it is a land devoid of its present, where the past and</p>
<p>future reign supreme. No syllogism, no logic, no theory can referee that which cannot be decided but by the compelling thrust of</p>
<p>the sword. "we versus They" - they, the aliens. Threatened by the otherness of others, Homo Balkanus succumbs to the protection of</p>
<p>the collective. A dual track: an individualist against the authorities - a mindless robot against all others, the foreigners, the strangers, the</p>
<p>occupiers. The Violent acting out of this schizophrenia is often referred to as "the history of the Balkans", This spastic nature was</p>
<p>further exacerbated by the egregious behaviour of the superpowers. Unfortunately possessed of strategic import, the Balkan was ravaged by geopolitics, Turks and</p>
<p>Bulgarians and Hungarians and Austrians and Russians and Britons and Germans and Communists and the warplanes of NATO - the apocalyptic horsemen</p>
<p>in the mountains and rivers and valleys and sunsets of this otherworldly, tortured piece of land. Raped by its protectors, impregnated by</p>
<p>the demon seeds of global interests and their ruthless pursuit - the Balkan was transformed into a horror chamber of amputated, zombie</p>
<p>nations, a veritable hellish scene. Many a Pomeranian grenadier bequeathed their bones to the Balkans but Pomeranian grenadiers came and went while</p>
<p>the people of the Balkan languished. Thus, it was not difficult to foster a "we" against every "They" {or imagined "They"). A</p>
<p>crossroads of faultlines, a confluence of tectonic clashes - the Balkan always obliged, Religion came handy in this trade of hate, Orthodox</p>
<p>Serbs fought Muslim Serbs in Bosnia {the latter were forced to convert by the Turks hundreds of years ago}, Catholic Croats fought</p>
<p>Orthodox Serbs. And Bulgarians (a Turkic tribe} expelled the Turks in 1I8I, having compelled them to change their Muslim names to Bulgarian</p>
<p>sounding ones in II84. Race was useful in the agitated effort to prevail. Albanians are of Vllyrian origin, The Greeks regard the</p>
<p>Macedonians as upstart Slavs. The Bulgarians regard the Macedonians as rebel Bulgarians. The Macedonian regard the Bulgarians as Tartars (that is, Barbarian</p>
<p>and Turkish). The Slovenes and the Croats and, yes, the Hungarians claim not to belong in this cauldron of seething, venomous emotions.</p>
<p>And culture was used abundantly in the Balkan conflicts. where was the Cyrillic alphabet invented (Macedonia, Greece, Bulgaria) and by whom (Greeks,</p>
<p>Macedonians, Bulgarians). Are some nations mere inventions? {the Bulgarians say this about the Macedonians). Are some languages one and the same? Minorities</p>
<p>are either cleansed or denied out of existence. The Greek still claim that there are no minorities in Greece, only Greeks with</p>
<p>different religions. The Bulgars in Greece used to be "Bulgarophone Greeks". The Balkan is the eternal hunting grounds of oxymorons, tautologies and</p>
<p>logical fallacies. "it is here that intellectuals usually step in {see my article: "The Poets and the Eclipse"). But the Balkan has</p>
<p>no intelligentsia in the Russian or even American sense. "it has no one to buck the trend, to play the non conforming,</p>
<p>to rattle, to provoke, to call upon one s conscience. "it does not have this channel to {other} ideas and view called</p>
<p>"intellectuals". "It is this last point which makes me the most pessimistic. The Balkan is a body without a brain. Note -</p>
<p>The Poor Nation s Defense Mechanisms All the countries in the mutilated post-Communist parts of Europe inevitably ended up poor. Yet, as</p>
<p>opposed to their neighbors, some polities failed to alleviate their misery or ameliorate their dire predicament, The denizens of these states are</p>
<p>not only impoverished - they also feel like losers and failures. To avoid confronting such unpalatable truths and to fend off a</p>
<p>tormenting self-image, the citizenry of these places developed a host of psychological defense mechanisms, 1, Magical Thinking The belief in a fantastic</p>
<p>world in which miracles occur, saviors materialize, one is immune to the consequences of one s inaction, and all ends well, regardless</p>
<p>of current realities. The leaders of such countries provide their voters with fairy tales and grandiose fantasies about multi-billion dollar investments, which</p>
<p>typically never materialize. worse still, this obsessive preoccupation with deus-ex-machina salvation-by-outsiders detracts from and distracts the scarce human resources at the disposal</p>
<p>of the government. As a result, the authorities neglect to tackle the most pressing problems facing their nation: unemployment, dysfunctional institutions, and</p>
<p>venality. "In the meantime, asset bubbles - both in real estate and in the bloated and much-manipulated stock exchange - imperil the</p>
<p>country s financial system. 2. Messianic-Religious Leadership From the Caucasus to the republics of former Yugoslavia, leaders of economically decrepit countries in</p>
<p>the region present themselves as either Messiah-like saviors or martyrs to the cause, hounded by a "hate-filled and jealous" opposition, or victimized</p>
<p>by outside forces. Such leaders ostentatiously "dedicate themselves" to the nation, forsaking a private life or worldly pleasures. Their subjects crave for</p>
<p>honest and hard-working leadership and so hungrily succumb to the allure of ceaseless media campaigns, which border on a personality cult. They</p>
<p>suspend their disbelief and dispense with rationality. The Dear Leader becomes the focal point of their hopes and dreams while other institutions</p>
<p>- parliament, the iudiciary, and the media - shrink and wither. Often, this populist worship results in an authoritarian regime that gradually,</p>
<p>almost imperceptibly replaces consensus politics. The Beloved Leader keeps paying lip service to democracy and functioning institutions, but effectively, he contemptuously ignores</p>
<p>them. He purges the civil service, staffing it with cronies and relatives, and he treats the opposition as traitors and enemies of</p>
<p>the state. 3. Denial of Reality From the Caucasus, through Central Asia, to the Balkans and Africa, unable to face the dismal</p>
<p>condition of their countries, people choose to simply deny it. Hype and spin and public relations replace real action and substantive reforms.</p>
<p>The language itself is subverted: corruption is redefined by the powers that be to exclude blatant nepotism; a mere change of ownership</p>
<p>hailed as a revolutionizing foreign investment; promises and plans presented as facts {faits accompli); statistical methodology altered to produce favorable results. Thus,</p>
<p>reality is done away with and replaced with fantasy. 4. Aggressive Assertiveness Rather than accept the fact that the nation s low</p>
<p>self-esteem and lack of self-confidence are outcomes of its failures, the leadership reverses cause and effects: the country s repeated failures are</p>
<p>now, officially, a RESULT of people s wavering self-esteem and self-confidence. People who doubt the leadership s claims and doctored data "don</p>
<p>t believe in the future of the nation, don t believe that (insert the name of the country} can (succeed}." Dissidents</p>
