<p>me what you know about the sphere," ryson asked. "what is it you wish to know exactly?" lief replied complacently.</p>
<p>ryson answered with all honesty. "i want to know everything." "that would take all the night and most of the</p>
<p>next day," lief countered. "besides, it seems you know of it already. it is clear to me that you have</p>
<p>an understanding of the legends. is there something in particular that confuses you?" "right now everything confuses me. you seem</p>
<p>to believe that the sphere is at the heart of whatever is going on. i can t argue that point,</p>
<p>and i don t wish to, but if the sphere is the reason behind this, i d like to know</p>
<p>more about it. i d also like to know why you talk about it with such distress." "it is very</p>
<p>dangerous," the elf stated simply. "that is why it was encased so long ago." "i realize that, but we ve</p>
<p>already run into things i have to consider more dangerous than anything else i ve ever faced in my life.</p>
<p>you keep worrying about the sphere. i ve heard the legends, but i ve never heard of elflore until you</p>
<p>mentioned it. maybe your story is different than mine." lief hesitated before speaking. he folded his hands across his chest,</p>
<p>but did not make an immediate reply. "you don t want to tell me?" ryson asked curiously but without sounding</p>
<p>offended. "no, that is not what concerns me," lief replied. "it is just that it is difficult to imagine how</p>
<p>fast things have happened. the tremor, the magic. now i sit in a tree with a delver who wishes to</p>
<p>know about elflore and what we might face. i will not deny you that knowledge. based on what you have</p>
<p>already done, it is your right to know. if i m to ask you to continue our iourney, it is</p>
<p>my obligation to tell you. it is just that less than a season ago, i would have considered such a</p>
<p>thing as impossible." "you don t have to tell me that," ryson responded with a knowing glance. "think how i</p>
<p>feel. at least you knew that humans and delvers existed. i couldn t have guessed that any of the legends</p>
<p>were actually true." "now you know differently," the elf said sternly. ryson eyed the elf and spoke with a careful</p>
<p>tone. "can i ask you a question before you tell me about the sphere?" "you may." ryson tried not to</p>
<p>hesitate, but he also wished to choose his words carefully. "are all elves like you? i mean, in the short</p>
<p>time i ve known you, you ve shown an interesting range of emotions. i don t mean any offense by</p>
<p>this. maybe i shouldn t even ask at all, but i ve noticed how you react to certain things. i</p>
<p>ve seen you laugh and smile a few times, but you re a rather grim individual. i don t want</p>
<p>to say you re impatient, because that s not true, but you seem to get annoyed easily. you really got</p>
<p>angry when we were dealing with the goblins. even when you and i talk, sometimes you sound as if you</p>
<p>re annoyed with me," "so you think i am perhaps too quick to anger?" ryson shook his head. "no, i</p>
<p>wouldn t say that. it s just that you seem to have a low tolerance for some things. i don</p>
<p>t think that saying you re angry would explain it. it s more like i said before. you get annoyed."</p>
<p>"don t concern yourself with insulting me," lief replied simply. "what you tell me now i have heard before." "really?"</p>
<p>"of course. my own kind have pointed it out to me. they say i am quite opinionated and that i</p>
<p>become quickly upset. they also say my outlook is much too grim. they say i will always find that which</p>
<p>is bleak, even in the best of times. i guess that is why no one wished to believe me when</p>
<p>i first spoke of the sphere." "the other elves say this? does that mean you re different from the others?"</p>
<p>lief raised an eyebrow. "does that surprise you?" "i don t know," ryson admitted. "i m just curious as to</p>
<p>what elves are like." "let me answer your question by asking you a similar one. what are delvers like? are</p>
<p>they all like you?" "no, i couldn t say that. we re all different." "the same applies to the elves.</p>
<p>we all have our different personalities. while there are some things you can perceive about elves through contact with just</p>
<p>one, it is not correct to make sweeping assumptions. while i might get easily annoyed, there is certainly another elf</p>
<p>that would hardly ever show such dissatisfaction. some elves may believe i am a very poor representative." ryson thought quietly</p>
<p>before responding. "poor representative or not, you re my first elf contact. i won t ever forget you." the elf</p>
<p>simply nodded and turned his focus upon the true sub/"ect of his own concerns. "then let us go back to</p>
<p>your first question. let me tell you about what i know of the sphere." the darkness continued to thicken as</p>
<p>lief began his tale. the air grew cool as the crickets began to chirp from the ground below. occasionally, the</p>
<p>hoot of an owl would cut through the insect s music, carried aloft by the night breeze. the sounds of</p>
<p>the darkness seemed to flow with the words of the elf, giving emphasis to the story. "since you tell me</p>
<p>you know much of the legends, i will not preface the story with any lengthy explanations," the elf noted quickly.</p>
<p>"a small introduction, however, is necessary. the sphere of ingar was created by the sorcerer ingar in a final attempt</p>
<p>to win ultimate control of all magic. the sphere was actually constructed from the hides of inhabitants from the land.</p>
<p>ingar sent out minions to capture elves, dwarves, humans, algors, and delvers. lore has it that he skinned them</p>
