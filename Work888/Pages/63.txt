<p>and quiet this morning, but what was once a bustling community of scientists was now a ghost town. approaching the</p>
<p>main entrance, they passed the scene of a great holocaust on the street outside the campus. a line of tv</p>
<p>communication vans parked in front of the von karman auditorium was now a row of blackened metal wrecks. although the</p>
<p>auditorium was intact, the pavement in front of it was blackened, and charred shapes lay scattered on the street. diedre</p>
<p>gasped, realizing the shapes were human bodies. several dozen people had been burned black by the death ray. they d</p>
<p>already begun to bloat and ooze dark liquid onto the pavement. diedre shuddered to think who those unrecognizable forms might</p>
<p>have been yesterday. beyond the wreckage, the main entry gate stood, empty. passing the gate on the way to their</p>
<p>lab building, they crossed a stretch of campus lawn landscaped intermittently with trees and bushes, diedre looked around her in</p>
<p>astonishment. "after all the explosions i heard, i thought the place would be in ruins." "not much damage at all,"</p>
<p>said frank, "just the power and the radio transmitters on the hill and the tv vans. that s all they</p>
<p>seemed to be after." diedre sighed. "i guess the sounds of explosions yesterday made things seem worse than they were."</p>
<p>"yeah," said frank. "those vans blew up with quite a racket." diedre noticed a man in an untucked white shirt</p>
<p>and wrinkled slacks in a planting bed shoveling dirt on what had been a bed of star iasmine. both the</p>
<p>man and the iob he was doing seemed out of place. "who s that?" she asked. "don t you recognize</p>
<p>him?" asked frank. "it s lloyd." approaching lloyd, diedre saw that his pile of dirt was grave-sized. lloyd s back</p>
<p>was to them and his flip-top hair blew in the breeze. "lloyd," she helloed. "it s frank and diedre," lloyd</p>
<p>turned as they walked up to him, but said nothing. a day s growth of stubble covered his chin and</p>
<p>cheeks and his pants and shirt were splotched with dirt and ash. he gazed at them dully with red-rimmed eyes.</p>
<p>he sat down on a stone bench beside the dirt pile, the corners of his mouth turned down bitterly. he</p>
<p>gestured at their surroundings. "she liked it here under the eucalyptus trees. you can almost see the whole campus." "she?</p>
<p>who?" asked diedre. lloyd said nothing, staring at the dirt. frank explained softly, "linda, his wife. tv news reporter, remember?</p>
<p>she died in the vans with the rest of them. lloyd left her there and came back to the lab</p>
<p>to get a dvd of images of phaeon for his presentation. he d finally decided to tell people everything we</p>
<p>knew. but while he was in the lab all hell broke loose." lloyd hunched over with his face in his</p>
<p>hands, reliving it all. "hey, lloyd," frank said cautiously. "diedre and i want to try reactivating clem." lloyd sat like</p>
<p>a statue with his eyes fixed on the grave. diedre tried to sound chipper. "whaddya think, lloyd? we ll find</p>
<p>a way to get clem up and running, just the three of us. just like the night we-" she almost</p>
<p>said, "-sent her down to look at phaeon," but stopped, remembering lloyd s uncontrite expression as he d sided with</p>
<p>maior macilvain. it was a hated memory but now his grief and his dirt-smeared hands made her feel like forgiving</p>
<p>lloyd. he d paid a terrible price for his complicity, staring at the dirt, he doubled a grimy fist and</p>
<p>hissed through clenched teeth, "i want to smash them, make them hurt like this." diedre put a hand on his</p>
<p>shoulder. "if we get a look at what they re doing up there, then maybe somebody can." they coaxed lloyd</p>
<p>to leave the grave with the shovel stuck in at one end as a marker and come with them across</p>
<p>the green campus to their own building. diedre was heartened to see that it was untouched by the beam. they</p>
<p>went to a basement entry door that led down to the clementine operations center, but frank paused to look at</p>
<p>the sky above the mountains. "guess what ll be rising any minute now." diedre followed his gaze through the smoky</p>
<p>haze over the craggy eastern horizon and saw one horn of the crescent moon poking up into the sky, goosebumps</p>
<p>rose on her arms. "we d better take cover," she said, but frank was in no hurry. he scratched in</p>
<p>his long frizzy brown hair. "i have a hunch they won t shoot at us. they re just after communications,</p>
<p>whoever they are." "just the same, i ll feel safer inside." a small gasoline powered generator purred beside the entrance</p>
<p>and diedre followed the orange power cable that snaked through the door, down the stairs and along the central corridor.</p>
<p>frank, adept at ad-hoc wiring, had tied it into the sub-basement s power grid, so when diedre reached the operations</p>
<p>center its fluorescent lights flickered a cool white greeting. as frank and lloyd followed her in, diedre realized that frank</p>
<p>/ohnston and lloyd andersen were probably the best co-conspirators she could hope for. frank s ability to work anything electrical</p>
<p>made it a foregone conclusion that they could fury-rig communications from earth to clementine. and lloyd knew as much about</p>
<p>the overall workings of ipl as anybody. she went to her old seat at the ace s computer terminal, sat</p>
<p>down and keyed in a command to retrieve the most recent clementine entries. the screen began reeling off a stream</p>
<p>of data. she smiled. "looks like we ve got a complete log of clem s activity up until we put</p>
<p>her on standby, with updates from her every six months since." frank and lloyd hemmed her in the way they</p>
<p>did on that night three years ago. somehow it felt more comfortable this time around. "great," said frank. "how s</p>
<p>her orbit?" "according to the last update she s still 55 kilometers up, orbiting directly over the poles. she</p>
