<p>driven to it." "oh, i should fight it out." "what s the use. they can t get past the committee even if they got a vote in the</p>
<p>house. i was talking to----" "patient s ready, sir," said the dresser. "talking to mcdonald--but i ll tell you about it presently." he walked back to the patient,</p>
<p>who was breathing in long, heavy gasps. "i propose," said he, passing his hand over the tumour in an almost caressing fashion, "to make a free incision over</p>
<p>the posterior border, and to take another forward at right angles to the lower end of it. might i trouble you for a medium knife, mr, iohnson?" the</p>
<p>novice, with eyes which were dilating with horror, saw the surgeon pick up the long, gleaming knife, dip it into a tin basin, and balance it in his</p>
<p>fingers as an artist might his brush. then he saw him pinch up the skin above the tumour with his left hand. at the sight his nerves, which</p>
<p>had already been tried once or twice that day, gave way utterly. his head swain round, and he felt that in another instant he might faint, he dared</p>
<p>not look at the patient. he dug his thumbs into his ears lest some scream should come to haunt him, and he fixed his eyes rigidly upon the</p>
<p>wooden ledge in front of him. one glance, one cry, would, he knew, break down the shred of self-possession which he still retained, he tried to think of</p>
<p>cricket, of green fields and rippling water, of his sisters at home--of anything rather than of what was going on so near him. and yet somehow, even with</p>
<p>his ears stopped up, sounds seemed to penetrate to him and to carry their own tale. he heard, or thought that he heard, the long hissing of the</p>
<p>carbolic engine. then he was conscious of some movement among the dressers. were there groans, too, breaking in upon him, and some other sound, some fluid sound, which</p>
<p>was more dreadfully suggestive still? his mind would keep building up every step of the operation, and fancy made it more ghastly than fact could have been. his</p>
<p>nerves tingled and quivered. minute by minute the giddiness grew more marked, the numb, sickly feeling at his heart more distressing. and then suddenly, with a groan, his</p>
<p>head pitching forward, and his brow cracking sharply upon the narrow wooden shelf in front of him, he lay in a dead faint, when he came to himself,</p>
<p>he was lying in the empty theatre, with his collar and shirt undone. the third year s man was dabbing a wet sponge over his face, and a</p>
<p>Couple of grinning dressers were looking on, "all right," cried the novice, sitting up and rubbing his eyes, "i m sorry to have made an ass of myself,"</p>
<p>"well, so i should think," said his companion. "what on earth did you faint about?" "i couldn t help it, it was that operation," "what operation?" "why, that</p>
<p>cancer." there was a pause, and then the three students burst out laughing. "why, you iuggins!" cried the senior man, "there never was an operation at all! they</p>
<p>found the patient didn t stand the chloroform well, and so the whole thing was off. archer has been giving us one of his racy lectures, and you</p>
<p>fainted just in the middle of his favourite story." it was a dull october morning, and heavy, rolling fog-wreaths lay low over the wet grey roofs of the</p>
<p>woolwich houses. down in the long, brick-lined streets all was sodden and greasy and cheerless. from the high dark buildings of the arsenal came the whirr of many</p>
<p>wheels, the thudding of weights, and the buzz and babel of human toil. beyond, the dwellings of the workingmen, smoke-stained and unlovely, radiated away in a lessening perspective</p>
<p>of narrowing road and dwindling wall. there were few folk in the streets, for the toilers had all been absorbed since break of day by the huge smoke-spouting</p>
<p>monster, which sucked in the manhood of the town, to belch it forth weary and work-stained every night. little groups of children straggled to school, or loitered to</p>
<p>peep through the single, front windows at the big, gilt-edged bibles, balanced upon small, three-legged tables, which were their usual adornment. stout women, with thick, red arms and</p>
<p>dirty aprons, stood upon the whitened doorsteps, leaning upon their brooms, and shrieking their morning greetings across the road, one stouter, redder, and dirtier than the rest, had</p>
<p>gathered a small knot of cronies around her and was talking energetically, with little shrill titters from her audience to punctuate her remarks, "old enough to know better!"</p>
<p>she cried, in answer to an exclamation from one of the listeners. "if he hain t no sense now, i specs he won t learn much on this</p>
<p>side 0 /ordan. why, ow old is he at all? blessed if i could ever make out." "well, it ain t so hard to reckon," said a sharp-</p>
<p>featured pale-faced woman with watery blue eyes. "he s been at the battle o waterloo, and has the pension and medal to prove it." "that were a</p>
