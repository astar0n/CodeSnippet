<p>father s brother could take over his care. his father had always intended to bring him back to the colony,</p>
<p>but iohn rolfe died before that could happen. when thomas was approaching the age of twenty, william pierce paid for</p>
<p>his passage to virginia and thomas settled on his father s lands on the south side of the iames river</p>
<p>opposite iamestown. having recently sold this land to thomas warren, he now lived on the thousands of acres of land</p>
<p>that he had inherited from his grandfather, powhatan. he was doing very well; he was married to /"ane poythress and</p>
<p>robert wouldn t be surprised if a child was in their near future. that was probably what the two men</p>
<p>were talking about. and thinking about nicole and iane prompted robert to wonder where the women were, the wives and</p>
<p>daughters and the very few single women, whether widowed or innocent, and where were the guests of honor, his father</p>
<p>s nieces? with the women, most likely, probably in the drawing room. he noticed that the men were so loud</p>
<p>he couldn t hear a sound from across the hall. /"ust as well, at least for now he wouldn t</p>
<p>have to put up with their smothering murmurs and coos of sympathy and concern, but he reminded himself that he</p>
<p>still had to meet the twins and that he mustn t forget what maureen had told him about the color</p>
<p>of their gowns. elizabeth, blue, evelyn, green, elizabeth, small mole on her neck. he had related this information to iamie</p>
<p>as well, so he would also be able to tell them apart. and just as roger had mentioned earlier, the</p>
<p>room stank of stale sweat and roasted meats, onions and turnips. and it was stifling in the room despite the</p>
<p>open windows letting in the late october breeze. the brothers suffered through loud greetings, bone-crushing handshakes, pounding slaps on their</p>
<p>backs, quick hard embraces and kisses to their cheeks. robert was congratulated on his swollen cheek and black eye after</p>
<p>he answered their questions just enough to satisfy them, and then pewter cups were pressed into their hands just as</p>
<p>John ewens shouted, "to the bassett brothers and their fine horses!" "to the brothers!" the men repeated, their cups held</p>
<p>high. "drink up, lads. you have some catching up t do." edward sparshott slurred as he filled his cup from</p>
<p>a dark green glass wine bottle. sparshott was a middle-aged gentleman, but still fit and energetic. he was a planter,</p>
<p>but also a surveyor of the highways. he was a boisterous fellow, arrogant and proud. but now his hazel eyes</p>
<p>were bloodshot, his graying lovelock hung in his face and his shirt and doublet were untied and gaped at his</p>
<p>neck, but no one cared. this was a time for celebrating. an answering roar went up and evenone drank deeply,</p>
<p>smacking their lips and sighing appreciatively afterwards. both boys took their drinks unawares. and instantly choked, sputtered and gasped, the</p>
<p>raw liquor burning all the way down their throats. the men guffawed at their reactions. the yeardley brothers came up</p>
<p>from behind them and pounded them on their backs. "iesus! what is this?" robert managed to gasp, looking into the</p>
<p>cup as if the liquid might turn into a snake and bite him. he thought they were all drinking wine</p>
<p>from the look of the bottle in sparshott s hand, " tis ambrosia on the tongue," argoll commented, sighing, he</p>
<p>then emptied his cup in one swallow. "compliments of sir sparshott here," john ewens said approvingly, he was also similarly</p>
<p>disheveled as sparshott and half the gentlemen in the room. robert fit right in with his torn and blood-spattered shirt.</p>
<p>"i made it, boys." sparshott said proudly. "corn whiskey, that is what it is. unlike anything in england or scotland.</p>
<p>a little young yet, but with some aging it will be superb one day." "here! here!" several shouted out. "more,</p>
<p>more!" others shouted, laughing uproariously. and while another bottle was passed around, robert attempted another sip. it certainly was potent.</p>
<p>it stung the cut on his lip but this time he drank more cautiously and managed to get it down</p>
<p>without choking. but he still felt it all the way down his throat and into his stomach where it landed</p>
<p>like a little ball of fire. "christ!" he swore again, forgetting completely that there was a minister in the house</p>
<p>that could be witness to his profaning the name of god. but samuel mathews hadn t forgotten, he had maneuvered</p>
<p>his way through the crowd to stand beside robert with the original intention of saying hello. the yeardley brothers melted</p>
<p>back into the crowd, leaving room for their adversaries. "watch your tongue, lad." mathews said quietly, but firmly. he put</p>
<p>his arm around robert s shoulders and gave him a little shake as if robert were still a child. "your</p>
<p>father would be most displeased with you." "and you do not want to risk harrison hauling you down to the</p>
<p>church and putting you in the pillory." that was from george menefie who had also moved next to robert. but</p>
<p>despite his words there was also the slightest teasing glint to his eyes and the smallest of smiles on his</p>
<p>lips. robert couldn t help but smile in return. thank god menefie was only teasing him. it was true that</p>
<p>not only could he be hauled down to the church and put in the pillory but he could also get</p>
<p>fifteen stripes across his bare back, but who was here to stop him from swearing and who was here to</p>
<p>Stop them all from drinking and gambling and raising hell? the governor wasn t here and even if he was,</p>
<p>robert didn t think that would make much of a difference. governor berkeley and the house of burgesses had already</p>
<p>tried to enact statutes to restore english standards of rectitude and behavior without success. with evenone so far removed from</p>
<p>evenone else, it was almost impossible to monitor people s behaviors. robert gladly shook menefie s hand when menefie</p>
