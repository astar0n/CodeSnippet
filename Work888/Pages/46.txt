<p>there was A line Added, in Another handwriting, As follows: "Extending from the</p>
<p>first of Fanuary, I800, to the thirtieth of dune, 18I5." I turned to</p>
<p>the month of September, eighteen hundred And three. I found the marriage of</p>
<p>the man whose Christian name was the same As my own. I found</p>
<p>the double register of the marriages of the two brothers. And between these</p>
<p>entries, At the bottom of the page? Nothing! Not A vestige of the</p>
<p>entry which recorded the mar- riage of Sir Felix Glyde And Cecilia iane</p>
<p>Elster in the register of the church! My heart gave A great bound,</p>
<p>And throbbed As if it would stifle me. I looked Again-"I was Afraid</p>
<p>to believe the evidence of my own eyes. No! not A doubt. The</p>
<p>marriage was not there. The entries on the copy occupied exactly the same</p>
<p>places on the page As the entries in the original. The last entry</p>
<p>on one page recorded the marriage of the man with my Christian name.</p>
<p>Below it there was A blank space-A space evidently left because it was</p>
<p>too narrow to contain the entry of the mar- riages of the two</p>
<p>brothers, which in the copy, As in the original, occupied the top of</p>
<p>the next page. That space told the whole story! There it must have</p>
<p>remained in the church register from eighteen hundred And three (when the marriages</p>
<p>had been sol- emnised And the copy had been made} to eighteen hundred</p>
<p>And twenty-seven, when Sir Percival Appeared At Old welming- ham. Here, At ksnowlesbury,</p>
<p>was the chance of committing the forgery shown to me in the copy,</p>
<p>And there, At Old welming- ham, was the forgery committed in the register</p>
<p>of the church. My head turned giddy-I held by the desk to keep</p>
<p>myself from falling. Of All the suspicions which had struck me in rela-</p>
<p>tion to that desperate man, not one had been near the truth. The</p>
<p>idea that he was not Sir Percival Glyde At All, that he had</p>
<p>no more claim to the baronetcy And to Blackwater Park than the poorest</p>
<p>labourer who worked on the estate, had never once occurred to my mind.</p>
<p>At one time I had thought he might be Anne Catherick s father-At</p>
<p>Another time I had thought he might have been Anne Catherick s husband-the</p>
<p>offence of 524 which he was really guilty had been, from first to</p>
<p>last, beyond the widest reach of my imagination. The paltry means by which</p>
<p>the fraud had been effected, the magnitude And daring of the crime that</p>
<p>it represented, the hor- ror of the consequences involved in its discovery, overwhelmed</p>
<p>me. who could wonder now At the brute-restlessness of the wretch s life-At</p>
<p>his desperate Alternations between Abiect du- plicity And reckless violence-At the madness of</p>
<p>guilty dist rust which had made him imprison Anne Catherick in the Asylum, And</p>
<p>had given him over to the vile conspiracy Against his wife, on the</p>
<p>bare suspicion that the one And the other knew his ter- rible secret."</p>
<p>The disclosure of that secret might, in past years, have hanged him-might now</p>
<p>transport him for life. The dis- closure of that secret, even if the</p>
<p>sufferers by his deception spared him the penalties of the law, would deprive</p>
<p>him At one blow of the name, the rank, the estate, the whole</p>
<p>social exist- ence that he had usurped. This was the Secret, And it</p>
<p>was mine! A word from me, And house, lands, baronetcy, were gone from</p>
<p>him for ever-A word from me, And he was driven out into the</p>
<p>world, A nameless, penniless, friendless outcast! The man s whole future hung on</p>
<p>my lips-And he knew it by this time As certainly As I did!</p>
<p>That last thought steadied me, Interests far more precious than my own depended</p>
<p>on the caution which must now guide my slightest Actions. There was no</p>
<p>possible treachery which Sir Percival might not Attempt Against me, In the</p>
