<p>was iames 4:14 - whereas ye know not what shall be on the next day. for what is your life?</p>
<p>it is even a vapor that appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth away. mike read the verse to</p>
<p>gene and then he noticed verse 1I - therefore, to him that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not,</p>
<p>to him it is sin. after mike read the verse, he closed his bible, and then he looked at gene</p>
<p>and told him that he knew what was right and what was wrong. he also knew what was good and</p>
<p>bad. "you cannot say you don t know what sin is." about that time, a verse came into mike s</p>
<p>memory. the verse was revelation 20:I5 - and whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast</p>
<p>into the lake of fire. after quoting it to gene, mike said, "you see, gene, your life is but a</p>
<p>Vapor, if you continue to sin, and if you die without accepting, you will go to that lake of fire</p>
<p>known as hell. i gave you what you wanted and now you must keep your promise. you said you would</p>
<p>accept." "mike, you did a real good fob in finding all of those verses. however, you hit the nail right</p>
<p>on the head. you said he that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him it is sin.</p>
<p>you see, i am a sinner and i guess you can say i am also a liar. i am not</p>
<p>going to accept. as a matter of fact, i am never going to accept." "gene, please don t say that,</p>
<p>i don t want you to go to hell." "well, i will talk to you later. i have a telephone</p>
<p>call to make. kh6-3224. is anne there?" "this is anne," "anne, this is gene. were you busy?" "gene, i am</p>
<p>never busy, if you are calling. as a matter of fact, i was having a fantasy about you. you remember</p>
<p>i said i would do anything, if you asked me out?" "that s the reason i m calling. i want</p>
<p>you to go out with me and we will see if you are all talk or if you really want</p>
<p>to see some action." "i am not lying to you. i will do anything that you ask. please, just give</p>
<p>me a chance to prove how much i really like you." "you know i don t have my license yet,</p>
<p>so where could we go so we won t be disturbed for about twenty minutes." "there is one place i</p>
<p>go all the time with my boyfriends. it s right here at my house. my little brother has a tree</p>
<p>house that my dad made for him two years ago. it has everything a couple could want, even a bed.</p>
<p>that s if you were wanting to go to bed with me?" "anne, i think you are reading my mind."</p>
<p>"gene, i can read your mind and the mind of all boys. they all want the same thing." "what night</p>
<p>do you want to me to come over?" "let s make it friday. my dad and mom bowl on that</p>
<p>night and for three hours, there won t be anyone around to bother us." friday night came quicker than gene</p>
<p>had anticipated. for a boy that had never done what he was hoping was going to happen, he was acting</p>
<p>just like a casanova. two knocks on anne s door and the door swung open very slowly. inside was a</p>
<p>very good looking, fifteen year old that had a reputation for getting whatever she wanted, and this night was not</p>
<p>going to be any different. she wanted gene. anne took gene s hand and walked toward the back door. "see</p>
<p>that tree right there? go on up and wait for me. i have to make two telephone calls." out the</p>
<p>door gene shot like a bullet. up the tree and he was all ready for what he thought was going</p>
<p>to be something close to heaven. he had been there for about five minutes when he heard anne coming up</p>
<p>the ladder. anne sat down beside gene and said she had wanted to kiss him since they were little kids.</p>
<p>with one big kiss, gene s toes started to curl. within ten minutes, everything that he had hoped would happen,</p>
<p>did happen. "gene, i love you so much. when we graduate, i want to be your wife. you love me,</p>
<p>don t you?" "oh, oh, yes, you know i love you, anne, and if you want to get married when</p>
<p>we graduate that will be fine. what we need to do is to figure out when we can do this</p>
<p>again. let s say in one or two days?" "gene, all you have to do is to tell me and</p>
<p>i am yours, always." "okay. sunday night, i will be over about eight." "gene, tell me again that you love</p>
<p>me." "anne, i love you." in gene s mind, he had already made plans to go to bed with as</p>
<p>many girls as he could while he was in high school. he also wanted the reputation with the girls that,</p>
<p>if you go out with him, you had better be ready to give in or you won t get another</p>
<p>date. if it took telling a girl that he loved her in order to go to bed, he decided he</p>
<p>would say anything that girl wanted to hear. anything. mike was out mowing the lawn when gene came running over</p>
<p>to him as fast as he could. "guess what i did last night?" "i give up. what?" "i went over</p>
<p>to anne s, and you will never guess what we did for ten lovely minutes." "gene, i don t want</p>
<p>to hear it." "mike, i thought you would be really happy that i believe in heaven now." "you mean you</p>
<p>went over to anne s and she led you to the lord?" mike asked with astonishment in his voice.</p>
