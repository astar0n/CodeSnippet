<p>the waitress who attended them, but she was entirely indifferent. He could see</p>
<p>that it was no pretence on her part. You didn t mind my</p>
<p>not sitting at one of your tables this afternoon? he asked once, when</p>
<p>he was walking to the station with her. Yours seemed to be all</p>
<p>full. This was not a fact, but she did not contradict him. Even</p>
<p>if his desertion meant nothing to her he would have been grateful if</p>
<p>she had pretended it did. A reproach would have been balm to his</p>
<p>soul. I think it s silly of you to sit at the same</p>
<p>table every day. You ought to give the other girls a turn now</p>
<p>and again. 8ut the more he thought of it the more he was</p>
<p>convinced that complete surrender on her part was his only way to freedom.</p>
<p>He was like a knight of old, metamorphosed by magic spells, who sought</p>
<p>the potions which should restore him to his fair and proper form. Philip</p>
<p>had only one hope. Mildred greatly desired to go to Paris. To her,</p>
<p>as to most English people, it was the centre of gaiety and fashion:</p>
<p>she had heard of the Magasin du Louvre, where you could get the</p>
<p>very latest thing for about half the price you had to pay in</p>
<p>London; a friend of 606 of 124I Of Human Bondage hers had passed</p>
<p>her honeymoon in Paris and had spent all day at the Louvre; and</p>
<p>she and her husband, my dear, they never went to bed till six</p>
<p>in the morning all the time they Were there; the Moulin Rouge and</p>
<p>I don t know what all. Philip did not care that if she</p>
<p>yielded to his desires it would only be the unwilling price she paid</p>
<p>for the gratification of her wish. He did not care upon what terms</p>
<p>he satisfied his passion. He had even had a mad, melodramatic idea to</p>
<p>drug her. He had plied her with liquor in the hope of exciting</p>
<p>her, but she had no taste for wine; and though she liked him</p>
<p>to order champagne because it looked well, she never drank more than half</p>
<p>a glass. She liked to leave untouched a large glass filled to the</p>
<p>brim, It shows the waiters who you are, she said. Philip chose an</p>
<p>opportunity when she seemed more than usually friendly. He had an examination in</p>
<p>anatomy at the end of March. Easter, which came a week later, would</p>
<p>give Mildred three whole days holiday. I say, why don t you come</p>
<p>over to Paris then? he suggested. we d have such a ripping time.</p>
<p>How could you? It would cost no end of money. 60I of I241</p>
<p>Of Human Bondage Philip had thought of that. It would cost at least</p>
<p>five- and-twenty pounds. It was a large sum to him. He was willing</p>
<p>to spend his last penny on her. what does that matter? Say you</p>
<p>ll come, darling. what next, I should like to know. I can t</p>
<p>see myself going away with a man that I wasn t married to.</p>
<p>You oughtn t to suggest such a thing. what does it matter? He</p>
<p>enlarged on the llories of the Rue de la Paix and the garish</p>
<p>splendour of the Folies Bergeres. He described the Louvre and the Son Marche.</p>
<p>He told her about the Cabaret du Neant, the Abbaye, and the various</p>
<p>haunts to which foreigners go. He painted in glowing colours the side of</p>
<p>Paris which he despised. He pressed her to come with him. You know,</p>
<p>you say you love me, but if you really loved me you d</p>
<p>want to marry me. You ve never asked me to marry you. You</p>
<p>know I can t afford it. After all, I m in my first</p>
<p>year, I shan t earn a penny for six years. Oh, I m</p>
<p>not blaming you. I wouldn t marry you if you went down</p>
