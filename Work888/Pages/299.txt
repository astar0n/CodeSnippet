his logical arrangement, being done, now this to you a true friend, say.
Namely. You mustn t go a-over-doing on it, but you must have your

supper and your wine-and-water, and you must be put betwixt the sheets. The
delicacy with which Foe dismissed this theme, and the sweet tact and kindness
with which Biddy - who with her woman s wit had found me

out so soon - had prepared him for it, made a deep impression

on my mind. But whether Foe knew how poor 9 was, and how

my great expectations had all dissolved, like our own marsh mists before the
sun, 9 could not understand. 838 of 865 Great Expectations Another thing in
foe that 9 could not understand when it first began to develop itself,

but which 9 soon arrived at a sorrowful comprehension of, was this.’ As

9 became stronger and better, Foe became a little less easy with me.

9n my weakness and entire dependence on him, the dear fellow had fallen
into the old tone, and called me by the old names, the dear

old Pip, old chap, that now were music in my ears. 9 too

had fallen into the old ways, only happy and thankful that he let

me. 8ut, imperceptibly, though 9 held by them fast, Foe s hold upon

them began to slacken; and whereas 9 wondered at this, at first, 9

soon began to understand that the cause of it was in me, and

that the fault of it was all mine. Ah.’ Had 9 given iloe

no reason to doubt my constancy, and to think that in prosperity 9

should grow cold to him and cast him off.’ Had 9 given iloe

s innocent heart no cause to feel instinctively that as 9 got stronger,

his hold upon me would be weaker, and that he had better loosen

it in time and let me go, before 9 plucked myself away? 9t

was on the third or fourth occasion of my going out walking in

the Temple Gardens leaning on 9oe s arm, that 9 saw this change

in him very plainly. we had been sitting in the bright warm sunlight,
looking at the river, and 9 chanced to say as we got up:

you shall see me walk back by myself. which do not over-do it,

Pip, said ﬂoe; but 9 shall be happy fur to see you able,

be weaker than 9 was, and asked 9oe for his arm. Foe gave

it me, but was thoughtful. 9, for my part, was thoughtful too.‘ for,

how best to check this growing change in 9oe, was a great perplexity

to my remorseful thoughts. That 9 was ashamed to tell him exactly how

9 was placed, and what 9 had come down to, 9 do not

seek to conceal; but, 9 hope my reluctance was not quite an unworthy

one. He would want to help me out of his little savings, 9

knew, and 9 knew that he ought not to help me, and that

9 must not suffer him to do it. 9t was a thoughtful evening
