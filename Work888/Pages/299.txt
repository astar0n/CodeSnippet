<p>his logical arrangement, being done, now this to you a true friend, say.</p>
<p>Namely. You mustn t go a-over-doing on it, but you must have your</p>
<p>supper and your wine-and-water, and you must be put betwixt the sheets. The</p>
<p>delicacy with which Foe dismissed this theme, and the sweet tact and kindness</p>
<p>with which Biddy - who with her woman s wit had found me</p>
<p>out so soon - had prepared him for it, made a deep impression</p>
<p>on my mind. But whether Foe knew how poor I was, and how</p>
<p>my great expectations had all dissolved, like our own marsh mists before the</p>
<p>sun, I could not understand. 838 of 865 Great Expectations Another thing in</p>
<p>foe that I could not understand when it first began to develop itself,</p>
<p>but which I soon arrived at a sorrowful comprehension of, was this." As</p>
<p>I became stronger and better, Foe became a little less easy with me.</p>
<p>In my weakness and entire dependence on him, the dear fellow had fallen</p>
<p>into the old tone, and called me by the old names, the dear</p>
<p>old Pip, old chap, that now were music in my ears. I too</p>
<p>had fallen into the old ways, only happy and thankful that he let</p>
<p>me. 8ut, imperceptibly, though I held by them fast, Foe s hold upon</p>
<p>them began to slacken; and whereas I wondered at this, at first, I</p>
<p>soon began to understand that the cause of it was in me, and</p>
<p>that the fault of it was all mine. Ah." Had I given iloe</p>
<p>no reason to doubt my constancy, and to think that in prosperity I</p>
<p>should grow cold to him and cast him off." Had I given iloe</p>
<p>s innocent heart no cause to feel instinctively that as I got stronger,</p>
<p>his hold upon me would be weaker, and that he had better loosen</p>
<p>it in time and let me go, before I plucked myself away? It</p>
<p>was on the third or fourth occasion of my going out walking in</p>
<p>the Temple Gardens leaning on Ioe s arm, that I saw this change</p>
<p>in him very plainly. we had been sitting in the bright warm sunlight,</p>
<p>looking at the river, and I chanced to say as we got up:</p>
<p>83.I of 865 Great Expectations See, Foe! I can walk quite strongly. Now,</p>
<p>you shall see me walk back by myself. which do not over-do it,</p>
<p>Pip, said ï¬‚oe; but I shall be happy fur to see you able,</p>
<p>sir. The last word grated on me; but how could I remonstrate! I</p>
<p>walked no further than the gate of the gardens, and then pretended to</p>
<p>be weaker than I was, and asked Ioe for his arm. Foe gave</p>
<p>it me, but was thoughtful. I, for my part, was thoughtful too." for,</p>
<p>how best to check this growing change in Ioe, was a great perplexity</p>
<p>to my remorseful thoughts. That I was ashamed to tell him exactly how</p>
<p>I was placed, and what I had come down to, I do not</p>
<p>seek to conceal; but, I hope my reluctance was not quite an unworthy</p>
<p>one. He would want to help me out of his little savings, I</p>
<p>knew, and I knew that he ought not to help me, and that</p>
<p>I must not suffer him to do it. It was a thoughtful evening</p>
<p>with both of us. But, before we went to bed, I had resolved</p>
<p>that I would wait over to-morrow, to-morrow being Sunday, and would begin my</p>
<p>new course with the new week. On Monday morning I would speak to</p>
<p>Foe about this change, I would lay aside this last vestige of reserve,</p>
<p>I would tell him what I had in my thoughts (that Secondly, not</p>
