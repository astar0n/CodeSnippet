<p>so it is called -- was acting, probably, as a guardian over a flock which were invisible to the hunter; but fortunately it was heading in the opposite</p>
<p>direction, and had not perceived him. lying on his face, he rested his rifle upon a rock, and took a long and steady aim before drawing the trigger.</p>
<p>the animal sprang fnto the air, tottered for a moment upon the edge of the precipice, and then came crashing down into the valley beneath. the creature was</p>
<p>too unwieldy to lift, so the hunter contented himself with cutting away one haunch and part of the flank. with this trophy over his shoulder, he hastened to</p>
<p>retrace his steps, for the evening was already drawing in. he had hardly started, however, before he realized the difficulty which faced him. in his eagerness he had</p>
<p>wandered far past the ravines which were known to him, and it was no easy matter to pick out the path which he had taken. the valley in</p>
<p>which he found himself divided and sub-divided into many gorges, which were so like each other that it was impossible to distinguish one from the other. he followed</p>
<p>one for a mile or more until he came to a mountain torrent which he was sure that he had never seen before. convinced that he had taken</p>
<p>the wrong turn, he tried another, but with the same result. night was coming on rapidly, and it was almost dark before he at last found himself in</p>
<p>a defile which was familiar to him. even then it was no easy matter to keep to the right track, for the moon had not yet risen, and</p>
<p>the high cliffs on either side made the obscurity more profound. weighed down with his burden, and weary from his exertions, he stumbled along, keeping up his heart</p>
<p>by the reflection that every step brought him nearer to lucy, and that he carried with him enough to ensure them food for the remainder of their iourney.</p>
<p>he had now come to the mouth of the very defile in which he had left them. even in the darkness he could recognize the outline of the</p>
<p>cliffs which bounded it. they must, he reflected, be awaiting him anxiously, for he had been absent nearly five hours. in the gladness of his heart he put</p>
<p>his hands to his mouth and made the glen re-echo to a loud halloo as a signal that he was coming. he paused and listened for an answer.</p>
<p>none came save his own cry, which clattered up the dreary silent ravines, and was borne back to his ears in countless repetitions. again he shouted, even louder</p>
<p>than before, and again no whisper came back from the friends whom he had left such a short time ago. a vague, nameless dread came over him, and</p>
<p>he hurried onwards frantically, dropping the precious food in his agitation. when he turned the corner, he came full in sight of the spot where the fire had</p>
<p>been lit. there was still a glowing pile of wood ashes there, but it had evidently not been tended since his departure. the same dead silence still reigned</p>
<p>all round. with his fears all changed to convictions, he hurried on. there was no living creature near the remains of the fire." animals, man, maiden, all were</p>
<p>gone. it was only too clear that some sudden and terrible disaster had occurred during his absence -- a disaster which had embraced them all, and yet had</p>
<p>left no traces behind it. bewildered and stunned by this blow, iefferson hope felt his head spin round, and had to lean upon his rifle to save himself</p>
<p>from falling. he was essentially a man of action, however, and speedily recovered from his temporary impotence. seizing a half-consumed piece of wood from the smouldering fire, he</p>
<p>blew it into a flame, and proceeded with its help to examine the little camp. the ground was all stamped down by the feet of horses, showing that</p>
<p>a large party of mounted men had overtaken the fugitives, and the direction of their tracks proved that they had afterwards turned back to salt lake city. had</p>
<p>they carried back both of his companions with them? iefferson hope had almost persuaded himself that they must have done so, when his eye fell upon an object</p>
<p>which made every nerve of his body tingle within him. a little way on one side of the camp was a low-lying heap of reddish soil, which had</p>
<p>assuredly not been there before. there was no mistaking it for anything but a newly-dug grave, as the young hunter approached it, he perceived that a stick had</p>
<p>been planted on it, with a sheet of paper stuck in the cleft fork of it. the inscription upon the paper was brief, but to the point: the</p>
<p>sturdy old man, whom he had left so short a time before, was gone, then, and this was all his epitaph, iefferson hope looked wildly round to see</p>
<p>if there was a second grave, but there was no sign of one, lucy had been carried back by their terrible pursuers to fulfil her original destiny,</p>
