so it is called -- was acting, probably, as a guardian over a flock which were invisible to the hunter; but fortunately it was heading in the opposite
direction, and had not perceived him. lying on his face, he rested his rifle upon a rock, and took a long and steady aim before drawing the trigger.
the animal sprang fnto the air, tottered for a moment upon the edge of the precipice, and then came crashing down into the valley beneath. the creature was
too unwieldy to lift, so the hunter contented himself with cutting away one haunch and part of the flank. with this trophy over his shoulder, he hastened to
retrace his steps, for the evening was already drawing in. he had hardly started, however, before he realized the difficulty which faced him. in his eagerness he had
wandered far past the ravines which were known to him, and it was no easy matter to pick out the path which he had taken. the valley in
which he found himself divided and sub-divided into many gorges, which were so like each other that it was impossible to distinguish one from the other. he followed
one for a mile or more until he came to a mountain torrent which he was sure that he had never seen before. convinced that he had taken
the wrong turn, he tried another, but with the same result. night was coming on rapidly, and it was almost dark before he at last found himself in
a defile which was familiar to him. even then it was no easy matter to keep to the right track, for the moon had not yet risen, and
the high cliffs on either side made the obscurity more profound. weighed down with his burden, and weary from his exertions, he stumbled along, keeping up his heart
by the reflection that every step brought him nearer to lucy, and that he carried with him enough to ensure them food for the remainder of their iourney.
he had now come to the mouth of the very defile in which he had left them. even in the darkness he could recognize the outline of the
cliffs which bounded it. they must, he reflected, be awaiting him anxiously, for he had been absent nearly five hours. in the gladness of his heart he put
his hands to his mouth and made the glen re-echo to a loud halloo as a signal that he was coming. he paused and listened for an answer.
none came save his own cry, which clattered up the dreary silent ravines, and was borne back to his ears in countless repetitions. again he shouted, even louder
than before, and again no whisper came back from the friends whom he had left such a short time ago. a vague, nameless dread came over him, and
he hurried onwards frantically, dropping the precious food in his agitation. when he turned the corner, he came full in sight of the spot where the fire had
been lit. there was still a glowing pile of wood ashes there, but it had evidently not been tended since his departure. the same dead silence still reigned
all round. with his fears all changed to convictions, he hurried on. there was no living creature near the remains of the fire." animals, man, maiden, all were
gone. it was only too clear that some sudden and terrible disaster had occurred during his absence -- a disaster which had embraced them all, and yet had
left no traces behind it. bewildered and stunned by this blow, iefferson hope felt his head spin round, and had to lean upon his rifle to save himself
from falling. he was essentially a man of action, however, and speedily recovered from his temporary impotence. seizing a half-consumed piece of wood from the smouldering fire, he
blew it into a flame, and proceeded with its help to examine the little camp. the ground was all stamped down by the feet of horses, showing that
a large party of mounted men had overtaken the fugitives, and the direction of their tracks proved that they had afterwards turned back to salt lake city. had
they carried back both of his companions with them? iefferson hope had almost persuaded himself that they must have done so, when his eye fell upon an object
which made every nerve of his body tingle within him. a little way on one side of the camp was a low-lying heap of reddish soil, which had
assuredly not been there before. there was no mistaking it for anything but a newly-dug grave, as the young hunter approached it, he perceived that a stick had
been planted on it, with a sheet of paper stuck in the cleft fork of it. the inscription upon the paper was brief, but to the point: the
sturdy old man, whom he had left so short a time before, was gone, then, and this was all his epitaph, iefferson hope looked wildly round to see
if there was a second grave, but there was no sign of one, lucy had been carried back by their terrible pursuers to fulfil her original destiny,
