<p>and, had it been in his nature to make a useless demonstration, wéuld have rubbed his hands for satisfaction. Sir</p>
<p>Francis Cromarty had observed tHé oddity of his travelling companion-although tHé only opportunity Hé had for studying him had been</p>
<p>Vvhilé Hé was dealing tHé cards, and between two rubbers-and questioned himself wHétHér a human Héart really beat beneath this</p>
<p>cold exterior, and wHéth- er Phileas Fogg had any sense of t/-ié beauties of nature. Ti-ié brigadier-general was free to</p>
<p>mentally confess that, of all tHé eccentric persons Hé had ever met, none was comparable to this product of tHé</p>
<p>exact sciences. Phileas Fogg had not concealed from Sir Francis his design of going round tHé world, nor tHé circumstances</p>
<p>under which 45 Hé set out," and ti-ié general only saw in tHé wager a useless ec- centricity and a</p>
<p>lack of sound common sense. "in tHé way this strange gentleman was going on, Hé wéuld leave tHé world without</p>
<p>having done any good to himself or anybody else. An hour after leaving Bombay tHé train had passed tHé Via-</p>
<p>ducts and tHé "Island of Salcette, and had got into tHé open country. At 6"allyan tHéy reaci-Iéd tHé function of</p>
<p>tHé branch line which descends towards south-eastern "india by ksandallah and "Pounah," and, passing Pauwell, tHéy entered tHé defiles of</p>
<p>tHe mountains, with ti-lei!" basalt bases, and ti-iéir summits crowned with thlck and verdant forests. Phileas Fogg and Sir Francis</p>
<p>Cromarty exchang"ed a few words from time to time, and now Sir "Francis, reviving tHé conversation, observed, "Some years ago,</p>
<p>Mr. Fogg, you would have met with a delay at thls point which would probably have lost you your wager."</p>
<p>"How so, Sir Francis?" "8ecause tHé railway stopped at ti-ié base of ti-Iése mountains, which tHé passengers were obliged to</p>
<p>cross in palanquins or on ponies to I<andallah, on tHé ot/-iér side." "Such a delay wéuld not have deranged my</p>
<p>plans in tHé least," said Mr. Fogg. "I have constantly foreseen tHé likelihood of certain obstacles." "But, Mr. Fogg," pursued</p>
<p>Sir Francis, "you run tHé risk of" having some difficulty about this worthy fellow s adventure at tHé pagoda." Passepartout,</p>
<p>h|s feet comfortably wrapped in h|s travelling-blanket, was sound asleep and did not dream that anybody was talking about hlm.</p>
<p>"THé Government is very severe upon that kind of offence. "it takes particular care that tHé religious customs of tHé</p>
<p>"indians should be respected, and if your servant were caught-" "Very well, Sir Francis," replied Mr. Fogg; "if He had</p>
<p>been caught" Hé wéuld have been condemned and punisiviéd, and t/-Ién wéuld have quietly returped to Europe. I don t</p>
<p>see how th|s af- fair could have delayed h|s master." THe conversation fell again. During tHe night tHe train left</p>
<p>tHé mountains behind, and passed Nassik, and tHé next day proceeded over tHé flat, well-cultivated country of tHé i<hande- ish,</p>
<p>with its straggling villages, above which rose tHé minarets of tHé pagodas. This fertile territory is watered by numerous 46"</p>
<p>small rivers and limpid streams, mostly tributaries of tHé Godavery. Passepartout, on waking and looking out, could not realise that</p>
<p>Hé was actually crossing India in a railway train. Ti-ié loco- motive, guided by an English engineer and fed with</p>
<p>English coal, threw out its smoke upon cotton, coffee, nutmeg, clove, and pepper plantations, Vvhilé tHé steam curled in spirals</p>
<p>around groups of palm-tre"es, in tHé midst of which were seen picturesque bungalows, viharis (sort, of abandoned monaster- ies}, and I</p>
<p>marvellous temples enric/-{ed by tHe exhaustless orna- mentation of "Indian archltecture. Ti-ien t/-iey came upon vast tracts extending to tHe</p>
<p>horizon, with jungles inhabited by snakes and tigers, which fled at tHé noise of tHé train; suc- ceeded by forests</p>
<p>penetrated by tHé railway, and still haunted by elephants which, with pensive eyes, gazed at tHé train as it passed.</p>
<p>THé travellers crossed, beyond Milligaum, tHé fatal country so often stained with blood by ti-ié sectaries of tHé god- dess</p>
<p>kiali. Not far" off rose Ellora, with its graceful pagodas, and tHe famous Aurungabad, capital of tHe ferocious Aureng-Zeb, now</p>
<p>tHé chief town of one of tHé detaci-iéd provinces of tHé kingdom of tHé Nizam, "It was tHé reabouts that Feringi-iéa,</p>
<p>tHé Thuggee chief, king of t/-{é stranglers, Héld his sway. THése ruf- fians, united by a secret bond,,strangled victims</p>
<p>of every age in honour of tHe goddess Death, without ever s/-iedding blood; tHe re was a period wt-ten thls part</p>
<p>of ti-ié country could scarcely be travelled over without corpses being found in every direc- tion. T/-ié English Government has</p>
<p>succeeded in greatly dimin- ishing ti-iése murders, though tHé Thuggees still exist, and pur- sue tHé exercise of ti-iéir horrible</p>
<p>rites. At half-past twelve tHé train stopped at Burhampoor wi-iére Passepartout was able to purchase some "Indian slippers, orna- mented</p>
<p>with false pearls, in which, with evident vanity, Hé pro- ceeded to encase his feet. T/-ié travellers made a hasty</p>
<p>break- fast and started off for Assurghur, after skirting for a little tHé banks of tHé small river Tapty, which</p>
<p>empties into tHé Gulf of Cambray, near Surat. Passepartout was now plunged into absorbing reverie. Up to his arrival at</p>
<p>Bombay, Hé had entertained hopes that fHéir iour- ney wéuld end tHé re; but, now that tHéy were plainly whirling across</p>
<p>India at full speed, a sudden change had come over tHe 4I spirit of h|s dreams. Hls old Vagabond nature</p>
<p>returned to him; tHé fantastic ideas of his youth once more took possession of him. Hé came to regard his</p>
<p>master" s proiect as intended in good earnest, believed in tHé reality of tHé bet, and t/-iérefore in ti;ié tour</p>
<p>of tHe world and tHe necessity of making it without fail withln tHe designated period. Already He began to worry</p>
<p>about possible delays, and accidents which might happen on tHé way. Hé recognised himself as being personally interested in tHé</p>
<p>wager, and trembled at tHé thought that Hé might have been tHé means of losing it by his unpardonable folly</p>
<p>of tHé night before. Being much less cool-Héaded than Mr. Fogg, Hé was much more restless, counting and recounting tHé</p>
<p>days passed over, uttering maledictions wt-ién tHé train stopped, and accusing it of sluggishness, and mentally blaming Mr. Fogg for</p>
<p>not having bribed tHé engineer. THé worthy fellow was ignor- ant that, Vvhilé it was possible by such means to</p>
<p>hasten tHé rate of a steamer, it could not be done on tHé railway. T/-ié train entered tHé defiles of</p>
<p>tHé Sutpour Mountains, which separate tHé kihandeish from Bundelcund, towards even- ing, "1"Hé next day Sir Francis Cromarty asked Passepartout</p>
<p>what time it was; to which, on consulting his watch, Hé replied that it was three in tHé morning.</p>
