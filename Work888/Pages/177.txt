<p>church the following sunday. maybe the lord was going to perform a miracle or maybe gene was having second thoughts</p>
<p>about his future home, heaven or hell. mike knew, besides having a son, gene was wanting at least three or</p>
<p>four more children. it may be that he wanted his children to have a personal relationship with the creator of</p>
<p>the universe, even if he did not choose that for himself, mike could only pray, but as you will see,</p>
<p>gene s children followed their parents and went down a road of destruction. mike s children, on the other hand,</p>
<p>were raised in a god fearing home where the lord was worshiped. "gene, everything that you believed, you learned from</p>
<p>your father. at this point, you were teaching those very same things to your children. they were going down that</p>
<p>same path of destruction just as you did. you are responsible for your children. you should have raised them in</p>
<p>the knowledge of me. i put one verse in mike s mind that would stay with him and his children,</p>
<p>so that his grandchildren would also be raised in a god-fearing home, that verse is found in proverbs 22:6 -</p>
<p>train up a Child in the way he should go and, when he is old, he will not depart from</p>
<p>it. you are the one that is responsible for your children going to hell, no one else can be held</p>
<p>accountable. i would have given you a verse to strengthen your family, also." "lord, there is nothing i can say,</p>
<p>i am guilty. i wish there was some way that my children could be reached before they come to this</p>
<p>place of torment." "mike spoke to you for years about accepting and you refused. mike s children will be as</p>
<p>close to your children as you and mike were. his children will tell your children about heaven and hell and</p>
<p>they will be just like you. they will refuse, also. but there will be one that will become so destitute,</p>
<p>that he will realize that he has to rely on someone else other than himself. he will drop to his</p>
<p>knees and will ask for me to come into his life. upon that request, i will enter his heart and</p>
<p>i will call him my son and he will call me his father. abba father," to the amazement of mike</p>
<p>and mary iane, they also had their second son the very same month that gene and roxann had their child.</p>
<p>some might say it was a coincidence, but it was very, very far from coincidence. god had planned out the</p>
<p>children that both families were going to have. he wanted gene to see the difference between a family that does</p>
<p>not want to have anything to do with him and a family that is god-center. if gene saw the difference,</p>
<p>maybe he would open his heart and get saved and lead his entire family to the lord. each time either</p>
<p>roxann or mary iane became pregnant, the other one would become pregnant, also. after their fifth child, both couples decided</p>
<p>that was enough. mike and gene went to see a doctor about having a vasectomy. gene seemed to be a</p>
<p>good husband and he would do anything for any of his friends. the only thing that neither his family nor</p>
<p>his friends knew about was his desire for women. after his third child, gene started to have one affair after</p>
<p>another. now that he was going to have a vasectomy, he did not have to worry about one of his</p>
<p>girl friend s claiming that he was the father of her baby. now gene could return to doing as he</p>
<p>pleased, as he always had before, but now with complete ease of mind knowing he would not get caught with</p>
<p>an illegitimate child. that could no longer happen. after the vasectomy, gene s affairs became hot and heavy. not only</p>
<p>was he having affairs with many of the women in his office, but he was also looking for, and finding,</p>
<p>very young women that wanted older men. most of these younger women were in their early twenties. each time a</p>
<p>love-making session was over, he always had a bad feeling inside. he always wanted to say it was indigestion or</p>
<p>something like that, but it was the lord that was making his conscience feel bad for his sin, even if</p>
<p>a person does not believe in god and they believe they can do anything they want, they still have a</p>
<p>conscience and when they commit sin, their conscience will react to the things that are wrong, gene was no different</p>
<p>than any other man. every time he committed sin, gene felt bad. once by mistake, or so gene said it</p>
<p>was a mistake, he told mike about the feeling he had when he did something that the bible said was</p>
<p>a sin. mike did not come out and say what it was. he wanted gene to ask for advice, or</p>
<p>to ask if mike could give an answer for the bad feeling. after explaining everything, he asked mike what he</p>
<p>thought could be the problem. it was at that time that mike explained to gene about the three inner beings</p>
<p>of a man. he told him of the soul, spirit, and conscience, after mike explained each in great detail, gene</p>
<p>thanked mike and left, on his trip home, he said to himself, "i sure made a mistake asking mike for</p>
<p>help. i should have known that he was going to put religion into his answer." each and every time he</p>
<p>had an affair, the Words of mike kept ringing in his ear about his conscience, the lord was bothering gene</p>
<p>s conscience so badly that it would take forever for him to get to sleep. the sleep he did have</p>
<p>was not the same kind of sleep he had other nights. the kind of sleep he had after an affair</p>
<p>was the kind of sleep that left you tired. it was a restless type of sleep. on the nights</p>
