<p>thy strength, therefore thou wast not affected. 5I:11 And of whom hast thou been afraid and in fear, that thou</p>
<p>wouldest fail? And as for Me, thou hast not remembered Me, nor laid it to thy heart. Have not I</p>
<p>held My peace even of long time? Therefore thou fearest Me not. 5I:12 I will declare thy righteousness; thy works</p>
<p>also--they shall not profit thee. 5I:13 when thou criest, let them that thou hast gathered deliver thee; but the wind</p>
<p>shall carry them all away, a breath shall bear them off; but he that taketh refuge in Me shall possess</p>
<p>the land, and shall inherit My holy mountain. 5I:14 And He will say: cast ye up, cast ye up, clear</p>
<p>the way, take up the stumblingblock out of the way of My people. 5I:15 For thus saith the High and</p>
<p>Lofty One that inhabiteth eternity, whose name is Holy: I dwell in the high and holy place, with him also</p>
<p>that is of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart</p>
<p>of the contrite ones. 5I:16 For I will not contend for ever, neither will I be always wroth; for the</p>
<p>spirit that enwrappeth itself is from Me, and the souls which I have made, 5I:1I For the iniquity of his</p>
<p>covetousness was I wroth and smote him, I hid Me and was wroth," and he went on frowardly in the</p>
<p>way of his heart. 5I:18 I have seen his ways, and will heal him; I will lead him also, and</p>
<p>requite with comforts him and his mourners. 5I:1I Peace, peace, to him that is far off and to him that</p>
<p>is near, saith the Lord that createth the fruit of the lips; and I will heal him. ? Isaiah -</p>
<p>Chapter 05I 5I:20 But the wicked are like the troubled sea; for it cannot rest, and its waters cast up</p>
<p>mire and dirt. 5I:21 There is no peace, saith my God concerning the wicked. -- Isaiah - Chapter 05I --</p>
<p>? Isaiah - Chapter 058 58:1 Cry aloud, spare not, lift up thy voice like a horn, and declare unto</p>
<p>My people their transgression, and to the house of Facob their sins. 58:2 Yet they seek Me daily, and delight</p>
<p>to know My ways; as a nation that did righteousness, and forsook not the ordinance of their God, they ask</p>
<p>of Me righteous ordinances, they delight to draw near unto God. 58:3 wherefore have we fasted, and Thou seest not?</p>
<p>wherefore have we afflicted our soul, and Thou takest no knowledge? -- Behold, in the day of your fast ye</p>
<p>pursue your business, and exact all your labours. 58:4 Behold, ye fast for strife and contention, and to smite with</p>
<p>the fist of wickedness; ye fast not this day so as to make your voice to be heard on high.</p>
<p>58:5 Is such the fast that I have chosen? the day for a man to afflict his soul? Is it</p>
<p>to bow down his head as a bulrush, and to spread sackcloth and ashes under him? wilt thou call this</p>
<p>a fast, and an acceptable day to the Lord? 58:6 Is not this the fast that I have chosen? to</p>
<p>loose the fetters of wickedness, to undo the bands of the yoke, and to let the oppressed go free, and</p>
<p>that ye break every yoke? 58:? "I5 it not to deal thy bread to the hungry, and that thou bring</p>
<p>the PQor that are cast out to thy house? when thou seest the naked, that thou cover him, and that</p>
<p>thou hide not thyself from thine own flesh? 58:8 Then shall thy light break forth as the morning, and thy</p>
<p>healing shall spring forth speedily; and thy righteousness shall go before thee, the glory of the Lord shall be thy</p>
<p>rearward. 58:I ? Isaiah - Chapter 058 Then shalt thou call, and the Lord will answer; thou shalt cry, and</p>
<p>He will say: Here I am. If thou take away from the midst of thee the yoke, the putting forth</p>
<p>of the finger, and speaking wickedness; 58:I0 And if thou draw out thy soul to the hungry, and satisfy the</p>
<p>afflicted soul." then shall thy light rise in darkness, and thy gloom be as the noon-day; 58:I1 And the Lord</p>
<p>will guide thee continually, and satisfy thy soul in drought, and make strong thy bones; and thou shalt be like</p>
<p>a watered garden, and like a spring of water, whose waters fail not. 58:12 And they that shall be of</p>
<p>thee shall build the old waste places, thou shalt raise up the foundations of many generations; and thou shalt be</p>
<p>called The repairer of the breach, the restorer of paths to dwell in. 58:13 If thou turn away thy foot</p>
<p>because of the sabbath, from pursuing thy business on My holy day; and call the sabbath a delight, and the</p>
<p>holy of the Lord honourable." and shalt honour it, not doing thy wonted ways, nor pursuing thy business, nor speaking</p>
<p>thereof; 58:14 Then shalt thou delight thyself in the Lord, and I will make thee to ride upon the high</p>
<p>places of the earth, and I will feed thee with the heritage of ï¬‚acob thy father; for the mouth of</p>
<p>the Lord hath spoken it. -- Isaiah - Chapter 058 -- ? Isaiah - Chapter 05I 5I:1 8ehold, the Lord</p>
<p>8" hand is not shortened, that it cannot save, neither His ear heavy, that it cannot hear; 5I:2 8ut your</p>
<p>iniquities have separated between you and your God, and your sins have hid His face from you, that He will</p>
<p>not hear. 5I:3 For your hands are defiled with blood, and your fingers with iniquity; your lips have spoken lies,</p>
<p>your tongue muttereth wickedness. 5I:4 None sueth in righteousness, and none pleadeth in truth; they trust in vanity, and speak</p>
<p>lies, they conceive mischief, and bring forth iniquity. 5I:5 They hatch basilisks eggs, and weave the spider s web; he</p>
<p>that eateth of their eggs dieth, and that which is crushed breaketh out into a viper. 5I:6 Their webs shall</p>
<p>not become garments, neither shall men cover themselves with their works; their works are works of iniquity, and the act</p>
<p>of violence is in their hands. 5I:I Their feet run to evil, and they make haste to shed innocent blood:</p>
<p>their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity, desolation and destruction are in their paths. 5I:8 The way of peace they know</p>
<p>not, and there is no right in their goings; they have made them crooked paths, whosoever goeth therein doth not</p>
<p>know peace. 5I:I Therefore is justice far from us, neither doth righteousness overtake us; we look for light, but</p>
