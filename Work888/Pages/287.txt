<p>less fortunate." "ladies who wear them?" "why, what else would they do? wear them -- of course, dear child." byng made a gesture of disgust. "well, i call</p>
<p>it sickening. to me there s something so personal and intimate about clothes. i think i could kill any woman that i saw wearing clothes of yours --</p>
<p>of yours." she laughed mockingly. "my beloved, you ve seen them often enough, but you haven t known they were mine; that s all." "i didn t recognize</p>
<p>them, because no one could wear your clothes like you. it would be a caricature. that s a fact, iasmine." she reached up and swept his cheek with</p>
<p>a kiss. "what a darling you are, little big man! yet you never make very definite remarks about my clothes." he put his hands on his hips and</p>
<p>looked her up and down approvingly. "because i only see a general effect, but i always remember colour. tell me, have you ever sold your clothes to the</p>
<p>mart, or whatever the miserable coffin-shop is called?" "well, not directly." "what do you mean by not directly ?" "well, i didn t sell them, but they were</p>
<p>sold for me," she hesitated, then went on hurriedly. "adrian fellowes knew of a very sad case -- a girl in the opera who had had misfortune, illness,</p>
<p>and bad luck; and he suggested it. he said he didn t like to ask for a cheque, because we were always giving, but selling my old wardrobe</p>
<p>would be a sort of lucky find -- that s what he called it." byng nodded, with a half-frown, however. "that was ingenious of fellowes, and thoughtful, too.</p>
<p>now, what does a gown cost, one like that you have on?" "this -- let me see. why, fifty pounds, perhaps. it s not a ball gown, of</p>
<p>course." he laughed mockingly. "why, of course, and what does a ball gown cost -- perhaps?" there was a cynical kind of humour in his eye. "anything from</p>
<p>fifty to a hundred and fifty -- maybe," she replied, with a little burst of merriment. "and how much did you get for the garments you had worn</p>
<p>twice, and then seen them suddenly grow aged in their extreme youth?" "ruddy, do not be nasty -- or scornful. i ve always worn my gowns more than</p>
<p>twice -- some of them a great many times, except when i detested them. and anyhow, the premature death of a gown is very, very good for trade.</p>
<p>that influences many ladies, of course." he burst out laughing, but there was a satirical note in the gaiety, or something still harsher. " we deceive ourselves and</p>
<p>the truth is not in us, " he answered. "it s all such a hollow make-believe." "what is?" she gazed at him inquiringly, for this mood was new</p>
<p>to her, she was vaguely conscious of some sort of change in him -- not exactly toward her, but a change, nevertheless. "the life we rich people lead</p>
<p>is a hollow make-believe, iasmine," he said, with sudden earnestness. "i don t know what s the matter, but we re not getting out of life all we</p>
<p>ought to get; and we re not putting into it all we ought to put in. there s a sense of emptiness -- of famine somewhere." he caught</p>
<p>the reflection of his face in the glass again, and his brow contracted. "we get sordid and sodden, and we lose the proportions of life. i wanted dick</p>
<p>wilberforce to do something with me the other day, and he declined. why, my dear fellow, i said, you know you want to do it? of course i</p>
<p>do, he answered, but i can t afford that kind of thing, and you know it. well, i did know it, but i had forgotten. i was only</p>
<p>thinking of what i myself could afford to do. i was setting up my own financial standard, and was forgetting the other fellows who hadn t my standard.</p>
<p>what s the result? we drift apart, wilberforce and i -- well, i mean wilberforce as a type. we drift into sets of people who can afford to</p>
<p>do certain things, and we leave such a lot of people behind that we ought to have clung to, and that we would have clung to, if we</p>
<p>hadn t been so much thinking of ourselves, or been so soddenly selfish." a rippling laugh rang through the room. "boanerges -- oh, boanerges byng! owever can you</p>
<p>be so heloquent!" iasmine put both hands on his shoulders and looked up at him with that look which had fascinated him -- and so many others --</p>
<p>in their day. the perfume which had intoxicated him in the first days of his love of her, and steeped his senses in the sap of youth and</p>
<p>eden, smote them again, here on the verge of the desert before him. he suddenly caught her in his arms and pressed her to him almost roughly. "you</p>
<p>exquisite siren -- you siren of all time," he said, with a note of ioy in which there was, too, a stark cry of the soul. he</p>
