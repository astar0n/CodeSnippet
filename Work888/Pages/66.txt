<p>forward. "we know it. y u and that hellish partner of yours shot him while he was locking the gate,</p>
<p>but y u made a mistake when y u come to fort lincoln, he lived there before he went to</p>
<p>be a guard at the arizona penitentiary. i m his brother. these gentlemen are his neighbors. y u re not</p>
<p>going back to prison. y u re going to stay right here under this cottonwood." if the extraordinary menace of</p>
<p>the man appalled neill he gave no sign of it. his gray eye passed from one to another of them</p>
<p>quietly without giving any sign of the impotent tempest raging within him. "you re going to lynch me then?" "y</p>
<p>u ve called the turn." "without giving me a chance to prove my innocence?" "without giving y u a chance</p>
<p>to escape or sneak back to the penitentiary." the thing was horribly unthinkable. the warm mellow afternoon sunshine wrapped them</p>
<p>about. the horses grazed with quiet unconcern. one of these hard-faced frontiersmen was chewing tobacco with machine-like regularity, another was</p>
<p>rolling a cigarette. there was nothing of dramatic effect. not a man had raised his voice. but neill knew there</p>
<p>was no appeal. he had come to the end of the passage through a horrible mistake. he raged in bitter</p>
<p>resentment against his fate, against these men who stood so quietly about him ready to execute it, most of all</p>
<p>against the girl who had let him sacrifice himself by concealing the vital fact that her brother had murdered a</p>
<p>guard to effect his escape. fool that he had been, he had stumbled into a trap, and she had let</p>
<p>him do it without a word of warning. wild, chaotic thoughts crowded his brain furiously. but the voice with which</p>
<p>he addressed them was singularly even and colorless. "i am a stranger to this country. i was born in tennessee,</p>
<p>brought up in the panhandle. i m an irrigation engineer by profession. this is my vacation. i m headed now</p>
<p>for the mal pais mines, friends of mine are interested in a property there with me and i have been</p>
<p>sent to look the ground over and make a report. i never heard of kinney till to-day. you ve got</p>
<p>the wrong man, gentlemen." "we ll risk it," laughed one brutally. "bring that riata, tom." neill did not struggle or</p>
<p>cry out frantically. he stood motionless while they adjusted the rope round his bronzed throat. they had judged him for</p>
<p>a villain; they should at least know him a man. so he stood there straight and lithe, wide-shouldered and lean-flanked,</p>
<p>a man in a thousand. not a twitch of the well-packed muscles, not a quiver of the eyelash nor a</p>
<p>swelling of the throat betrayed any fear. his cool eyes were quiet and steady. "if you want to leave any</p>
<p>message for anybody i ll see it s delivered," promised duffield. "i ll not trouble you with any." "just as</p>
<p>you like." "he didn t give poor dave any time for messages," cried tom long bitterly. "that s right," assented</p>
<p>another with a curse. it was plain to the victim they were spurring their nerves to hardihood. "who s that?"</p>
<p>cried one of the men, pointing to a rider galloping toward them. the newcomer approached rapidly, covered by their weapons,</p>
<p>and flung himself from his pony as he dragged it to a halt beside the group. "steve fraser," cried duffield</p>
<p>in surprise, and added, "he s an officer in the rangers," "right, gentlemen, come to claim my prisoner," said the</p>
<p>ranger promptly. "y u can t have him, steve. we took him and he s got to hang." the lieutenant</p>
<p>of rangers shook his dark curly head. "won t do, duffield. won 1." do at all," he said decisively. "you</p>
<p>d ought to know law s on top in texas these days." tom long shouldered his way to the front.</p>
<p>"law! where was the law when this ruffian kinney shot down my poor brother dave? i guess a rope and</p>
<p>a cottonwood s good enough law for him. anyhow, that s what he gits." fraser, hard-packed, lithe, and graceful, laid</p>
<p>a friendly hand on the other s shoulder and smiled sunnily at him. "i know how you feel, tom. we</p>
<p>all thought a heap of dave and you re his brother. but dave died for the law. both you boys</p>
<p>have always stood for order. he d be troubled if he knew you were turned enemy to it on his</p>
<p>account." "i m for justice, steve. this skunk deserves death and i m going to see he gits it." "no</p>
<p>tom." "i say yes. .V u ain t sitting in this game, steve." "i reckon i ll have to take</p>
<p>a hand then." the ranger s voice was soft and drawling, but his eyes were indomitably steady. throughout the southwest</p>
<p>his reputation for fearlessness was established even among a population singularly courageous. the audacity of his daredevil recklessness was become</p>
<p>a proverb. "we got a full table. better ride away and forget it," said another. "that ain t what i</p>
<p>m paid for, jack," returned fraser good-naturedly. "better turn him over to me peaceable, boys. he ll get what s</p>
<p>coming to him all right." "he ll get it now, steve, without any help of yours. we don t aim</p>
<p>to allow any butting in." "don t you?" there was a flash of steel as the ranger dived forward. next</p>
<p>instant he and the prisoner stood with their backs to the cottonwood, a revolver having somehow leaped from its scabbard</p>
<p>to his hand. his hunting-knife had sheared at a stroke the riata round the engineer s neck. "take it easy,</p>
<p>boys," urged fraser, still in his gentle drawl, to the astonished vigilantes whom his sudden sally had robbed of their</p>
<p>victim. "think about it twice. we ll all be a long time dead. no use in hurrying the funerals." nevertheless</p>
<p>he recognized battle as inevitable. friends of his though they were, he knew these sturdy plainsmen would never submit</p>
<p>I</p>
