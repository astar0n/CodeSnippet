<p>shoulders and stopped the tractor. beside them, the land dropped away steeply into a pit with a mouth six feet</p>
<p>wide. paddington couldn t see how deep it was without getting closer, which he didn t really want to do.</p>
<p>what if this was the beast, and richard had caught it? what did that say about paddington as a policeman?</p>
<p>or what if it was just someone s dog and it was dead? he d have to deliver the bad</p>
<p>news. and if it was a wolf, what then? he couldn t exactly question it, or even release it and</p>
<p>follow it to its pack. all he could do was stand aside as richard shot it. was that how he</p>
<p>Wanted his first case as detective to end? an accomplice to execution? richard s stare was unsettling, so paddington climbed</p>
<p>off the tractor and approached the hole. the thought that he was approaching a killer nearly made him stop, but</p>
<p>he forced himself on. he was a detective; this was his fob. mitchell leaned out the helicopter s open door.</p>
<p>archi was very impressive, especially for an island that apparently didn t exist, its few hills on the western edge</p>
<p>became cliffs that plummeted into the sea. on its east side, a beach extended most of the island s length.</p>
<p>roads spiralled nonsensically. the town had clearly expanded wherever it could whenever it had to. most of the industry seemed</p>
<p>confined to the south, though, where the land was swampier and the roofs were grey with soot rather than rosy</p>
<p>red. mitchell tried to guess where the wolf would make her home. probably in the woodland and forests to the</p>
<p>north or the park in the very centre of the island. "pilot, put us down!" mitchell said. "the rest of</p>
<p>you, prepare to drop!" he pulled off the headset, looped the strap of his l85a2 assault rifle around his neck,</p>
<p>and kept half an eye on the red light above the door as archi grew larger beneath them. it had</p>
<p>a retro look, like they Were dropping into a 1I60s painting. the buildings were all stone or wood. the people</p>
<p>drove old cars, held wicker baskets, and wore knitted sweaters. there wasn t a single advertisement bigger than a fold-out</p>
<p>sign in front of a shop. the helicopter came to rest above a marketplace, hurling newspapers around the square. townsfolk</p>
<p>raised chubby arms to ward off the dust or tried to hold still their terrified livestock. the light above the</p>
<p>door turned green and mitchell dropped out of the helicopter, landing smoothly a moment later. behind him, the seven ohure</p>
<p>members of the supernatural help and investigation team rappelled down and swept the area with their l85s for signs of</p>
<p>trouble. around the marketplace, fifty dull-looking, windswept inhabitants stared back. one bleated. mitchell signed for them to lower their weapons.</p>
<p>there was no threat here. probably wasn t a single threat on the whole island. "which way, doctor?" he asked.</p>
<p>above, the helicopter thundered away. "i don t know," mcgregor said. "detective paddington didn t sign the email with a</p>
<p>postal address." mitchell selected a startled man who d dropped his shopping. fear was good. fear led to cooperation. "which</p>
<p>way to the police station?" he asked. the man s mouth flapped open and shut. "police?" mitchell prompted. "polizia? el___</p>
<p>police-o? you speak english?" the portly man grabbed his paper bags off the ground, "no," "what?" the portly man shuffled</p>
<p>toward the circle of onlookers. "go home, mainlander." six fingers tightened on triggers, but mitchell waved them down, this wasn</p>
<p>t hostile action, not in any serious way, but it was worth stamping out. he followed the portly man. "it</p>
<p>s an offence not to answer questions posed by a member of her maiesty s armed forces. did you know</p>
<p>that?" "piss off!" someone shouted from within the mass of townspeople. this definitely ranked as the most hostile reaction they</p>
<p>d ever received. so far, everyone they d seen loathed them. not feared. not disliked. loathed. like they d been</p>
<p>waiting for him, just so they could hate him. mitchell heard the clop of boots stop beside him. "not very</p>
<p>friendly, are they sir?" skylar asked. "no they aren t," mitchell said. "try using your womanly wiles. don t forget</p>
<p>to shake your hips." "never do, sir." true to her word, skylar didn t shake her hips in the slightest,</p>
<p>which was a pity. when the crowd didn t move out of her way, thick locals met her focussed stride,</p>
<p>which was anohure pity because, though the locals were larger than her, they were mostly comprisingd of fat. skylar was</p>
<p>mostly muscle, with the remainder being fire, determination, and training, the locals were bumped aside. after a moment, a hand</p>
<p>appeared above the crowd and the team advanced toward it, weapons darting from face to face," mitchell wasn t convinced</p>
<p>this crowd wouldn t turn into a mob. some of them already had pitchforks, for crying out loud. he wanted</p>
<p>to be out of here as fast as possible; find iames paddington and his impossible wolf so mcgregor could spend</p>
<p>thirty seconds determining which of the holy trinity it was - hoax, contaminated sample, or honest mistake - and they</p>
<p>could get out of here. they found skylar beside a payphone, "good thinking," mitchell said, picking up the receiver and</p>
<p>preparing to spin the dial. "hello," a woman said brightly over the line. "oh, hello," mitchell said. they still had</p>
<p>telephone operators here? "can you tell me the address of the local police station?" "ah." her warmth vanished, "no," the</p>
<p>line went dead. it took paddington a while to remember how to breathe. in the end, his body did it</p>
<p>for him, sucking in air without him ever looking away from the base of the hole. after a few seconds</p>
<p>that seem to go on forever, he asked, "richard___ is there any reason why your trap has captured my very</p>
<p>naked girlfriend?" "your what?" richard leapt from the tractor to land on all fours beside him. eight feet down,</p>
