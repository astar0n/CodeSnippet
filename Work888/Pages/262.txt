<p>A re- lapse, her weakened physical energies giving way under</p>
<p>the severe mental Affliction from which she was now suffering.</p>
<p>On getting stronger Again, in A month s time, her</p>
<p>suspicion of the circumstances described As Attending her sister s</p>
<p>death still re- mained unshaken. She had heard nothing in</p>
<p>the interim of Sir Percival Glyde, but letters had reached</p>
<p>her from Madame Fo- sco, making the most Affectionate inquiries</p>
<p>on the part of her husband And herself. "Instead of</p>
<p>Answering these letters, Miss Halcombe caused the house in St.</p>
<p>ï¬‚ohn s wood, And the pro- ceedings of its inmates,</p>
<p>to be privately watched. Nothing doubtful was discovered. The same</p>
<p>result Attended the next investigations, which were secretly instituted on</p>
<p>the subiect of Mrs. Rubelle. She had Arrived in London</p>
<p>About six months before with her husband. They had come</p>
<p>from Lyons, And they had taken A house in the</p>
<p>neighbourhood of Leicester Square, to be fitted up As A</p>
<p>boarding-house for foreigners, who were expected to visit England in</p>
<p>large numbers to see the Ex- hibition of 1851, Nothing</p>
<p>was known Against husband or wife in the neighbourhood. They</p>
<p>were quiet people, And they had paid their way honestly</p>
<p>up to the present time. The final inquir- ies related</p>
<p>to Sir Percival Glyde. He was settled in Paris, And</p>
<p>living there quietly in A small circle of English And</p>
<p>French friends. Foiled At All points, but still not Able</p>
<p>to rest, Miss Halcombe next determined to visit the Asylum</p>
<p>in which she then sup- posed Anne Catherick to be</p>
<p>for the second time confined. She had felt A strong</p>
<p>curiosity About the woman in former days, And she was</p>
<p>now doubly interested-first, in Ascertaining whether the report of Anne</p>
<p>Catherick s Attempted personation of Lady Glyde was true, And</p>
<p>secondly (if it proved to be true}, in discovering for</p>
<p>herself what the poor creature s real motives were for</p>
<p>Attempting the deceit. 42I Although Count Fosco s letter to</p>
<p>Mr. Fairlie did not mention the Address of the Asylum,</p>
<p>that important omission cast no dif- ficulties in Miss Halcombe</p>
<p>s way. when Mr. Hartright had met Anne Catherick At</p>
<p>Limmeridge, she had informed him of the locality in which</p>
<p>the house was situated, And Miss Halcombe had noted down</p>
<p>the direction in her diary, with All the other particulars</p>
<p>of the interview exactly As she heard them from Mr.</p>
<p>Hartright s own lips. Accordingly she looked back At the</p>
<p>entry And extracted the Address-furnished herself with the count s</p>
<p>letter to Mr. Fairlie As A species of credential which</p>
<p>might be useful to her, And started by herself for</p>
<p>the Asylum on the elev- enth of October. She passed</p>
<p>the night of the eleventh in London. "it had been</p>
<p>her intention to sleep At the house inhabited by Lady</p>
<p>Glyde s old governess, but Mrs. Vesey s Agitation At</p>
<p>the sight of her lost pupil s nearest And dearest</p>
<p>friend was so distressing that Miss Halcombe considerately refrained from</p>
<p>remaining in her presence, And removed to A respectable boarding-house</p>
<p>in the neighbourhood, recommended by Mrs. Vesey s married sister.</p>
<p>The next day she proceeded to the Asylum, which was</p>
<p>situated not far from London on the northern side of</p>
<p>the metropolis. She was immediately Admitted to see the proprietor.</p>
