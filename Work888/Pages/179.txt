<p>else. In Germany you must do what everybody else does, but you may</p>
<p>think as you choose. They re both very good things. I personally prefer</p>
<p>freedom of thought. 8ut in England you get neither: you re ground down</p>
<p>by convention. You can t think as you like and you can t</p>
<p>act as you like. That s because it s a democratic nation. I</p>
<p>expect America s worse. 185 of 1241 Of Human Bondage He leaned back</p>
<p>cautiously, for the chair on which he sat had a ricketty leg, and</p>
<p>it was disconcerting when a rhetorical flourish was interrupted by a sudden fall</p>
<p>to the floor. I ought to go back to England this year, but</p>
<p>if I can scrape together enough to keep body and soul on speaking</p>
<p>terms I shall stay another twelve months. But then I shall have to</p>
<p>go. And I must leave all this -he waved his arm round the</p>
<p>dirty garret, with its unmade bed, the clothes lying on the floor, a</p>
<p>row of empty beer bottles against the wall, piles of unbound, ragged books</p>
<p>in every corner- for some provincial university where I shall try and get</p>
<p>a chair of philology. And I shall play tennis and go to tea-parties.</p>
<p>He interrupted himself and gave Philip, very neatly dressed, with a clean collar</p>
<p>on and his hair well-brushed, a quizzical look. And, my God." I shall</p>
<p>have to wash, Philip reddened, fÔ¨Åeling his own spruceness an intolerable reproach; for</p>
<p>of late he had begun to pay some attention to his toilet, and</p>
<p>he had come out from England with a pretty selection of ties. The</p>
<p>summer came upon the country like a conqueror. Each day was beautiful. The</p>
<p>sky had an arrogant blue which goaded the nerves like a spur. The</p>
<p>green of the trees in the Anlage was violent and crude; and the</p>
<p>houses, 186 of 1241 Of Human Bondage when the sun caught them, had</p>
<p>a dazzling white which stimulated till it hurt. Sometimes on his way back</p>
<p>from wharton Philip would sit in the shade on one of the benches</p>
<p>in the Anlage, enjoying the coolness and watching the patterns of light which</p>
<p>the sun, shining through the leaves, made on the ground. His soul danced</p>
<p>with delight as gaily as the sunbeams. He revelled in those moments of</p>
<p>idleness stolen from his work. Sometimes he sauntered through the streets of the</p>
<p>old town. He looked with awe at the students of the corps, their</p>
<p>cheeks gashed and red, who swaggered about in their coloured caps. In the</p>
<p>afternoons he wandered about the hills with the girls in the Frau Professor</p>
<p>s house, and sometimes they "went up the river and had tea in</p>
<p>a leafy beer-garden. In the evenings they walked round and round the Stadtgarten,</p>
<p>listening to the band. Philip soon learned the various interests of the household.</p>
<p>Fraulein Thekla, the professor s elder daughter, was engaged to a man in</p>
<p>England who had spent twelve months in the house to learn German, and</p>
<p>their marriage was to take place at the end of the year. But</p>
<p>the young man wrote that his father, an india-rubber merchant who lived in</p>
<p>Slough, did not approve of the union, and Fraulein Thekla was often in</p>
<p>tears. Sometimes she and her 18I of 1241 Of Human Bondage mother might</p>
<p>be seen, with stern eyes and determined mouths, looking over the letters of</p>
<p>the reluctant lover. Thekla painted in water colour, and occasionally she and Philip,</p>
<p>with another of the girls to keep them company, would go out and</p>
<p>paint little pictures. The pretty Fraulein Hedwig had amorous troubles too. She was</p>
<p>the daughter of a merchant in Berlin and a dashing hussar had fallen</p>
<p>in love with her, a von if you please: but his parents opposed</p>
<p>a marriage with a person of her condition, and she had been sent</p>
<p>to Heidelberg to forget him. She could never, never do this, and</p>
