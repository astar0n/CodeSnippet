<p>pay an allowance if Philip went to Paris, 343 of 1241 Of Human</p>
<p>Bondage 4t s a mere excuse for self-indulgence and sensuality, he said. 4</p>
<p>m interested to hear you blame self-indulgence in others, retorted Philip acidly. But</p>
<p>by this time an answer had come from Hayward, giving the name of</p>
<p>a hotel where Philip could get a room for thirty francs a month</p>
<p>and enclosing a note of introduction to the massiere of a school. Philip</p>
<p>read the letter to Mrs. Carey and told her he proposed to start</p>
<p>on the first of September. But you haven t got any money? she</p>
<p>said. 4 m going into Tercanbury this afternoon to sell the iewellery. He</p>
<p>had inherited from his father a gold watch and chain, two or three</p>
<p>rings, some links, and two pins. One of them was a pearl and</p>
<p>might fetch a considerable sum. 4t s a very different thing, what a</p>
<p>thing s worth and what it ll fetch, said Aunt Lbuisa. Philip smiled,</p>
<p>for this was one of his uncle s stock phrases. 4 know, but</p>
<p>at the worst 4 think 4 can get a hundred pounds on the</p>
<p>lot, and that ll keep me till 4 m twenty- one. 344 of</p>
<p>1241 Of Human Bondage Mrs. Carey did not answer, but she went upstairs,</p>
<p>put on her little black bonnet, and went to the bank. 4n an</p>
<p>hour she came back. She went to Philip, who was reading in the</p>
<p>drawing-room, and handed him an envelope. what s this? he asked. 4t s</p>
<p>a little present for you, she answered, smiling shyly. He opened it and</p>
<p>found eleven five-pound notes and a little paper sack bulging with sovereigns. 4</p>
<p>couldn t bear to let you sell your father s iewellery. 4t s</p>
<p>the money 4 had in the bank. 4t comes to very nearly a</p>
<p>hundred pounds. Philip blushed, and, he knew not why, tears suddenly filled his</p>
<p>eyes. Oh, my dear, 4 can t take it, he said. 4t s</p>
<p>most awfully good of you, but 4 couldn t bear to take it.</p>
<p>when Mrs. Care)" "was married she had three hundred pounds, and this money,</p>
<p>carefully watched, had been used by her to meet any unforeseen expense, any</p>
<p>urgent charity, or to buy Christmas and birthday presents for her husband and</p>
<p>for Philip. 4n the course of years it had diminished sadly, but it</p>
<p>was still with the Vicar a subiect for iesting. He talked of his</p>
<p>wife as a rich woman and he constantly spoke of the nest egg.</p>
<p>345 of 1241 Of Human Bondage Oh, please take it, Philip. 4 In</p>
<p>so sorry 4 ve been extravagant, and there s only that left. But</p>
<p>it ll make me so happy if you ll accept it. But you</p>
<p>ll want it, said Philip. No, 4 don t think 4 shall. 4</p>
<p>was keeping it in case YÔ¨Åur uncle died before me. 4 thought it</p>
<p>would be useful to have a little something 4 could get at immediately</p>
<p>if 4 wanted it, but 4 don t think 4 shall live very</p>
<p>much longer now. Oh, my dear, don t say that. why, of course</p>
<p>you re going to live for ever. 4 can t possibly spare you.</p>
<p>Oh, 4 m not sorry. Her voice broke and she hid her eyes,</p>
<p>but in a moment, drying them, she smiled bravely. At first, 4 used</p>
<p>to pray to God that He might not take me first, because 4</p>
<p>didn t want your uncle to be left alone, 4 didn t want</p>
<p>him to have all the suffering, but now 4 know that it wouldn</p>
<p>t mean so much to your uncle as it would mean to me.</p>
<p>He wants to live more than 4 do, 4 ve never been the</p>
<p>wife he wanted, and 4 daresay he d marry again if anything happened</p>
<p>to me. So 4 should like to go first. You don t</p>
