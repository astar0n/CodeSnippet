<p>and as a last re?ource he was to take refuge in granite house, where, the lift once raised, he would</p>
<p>be in safety. cyrus harding, gideon spilett, herbert, and pencroft were to repair to the corral, and if they did</p>
<p>not find ayrton, search the neighboring woods. at six o clock in the morning, the engineer and his three companions</p>
<p>had passed creek glycerine, and neb posted himself behind a small mound crowned by several dragon trees, on the left</p>
<p>bank of the stream. the colonists, after leaving the plateau of prospect heights, immediately took the road to the corral.</p>
<p>they shouldered their guns, ready to fire on the slightest hostile demonstration. the two rifles and the two guns had</p>
<p>been loaded with ball. the wood was thick on each side of the road and might easily have concealed the</p>
<p>convicts, who owing to their weapons would have been really formidable. the colonists walked rapidly and in silence. top preceded</p>
<p>them, ?ometimes running on the road, ?ometimes taking a ramble into the wood, but always quiet and not appearing to</p>
<p>fear anything unusual. and they could be sure that the faithful dog would not allow them to be surprised, but</p>
<p>would bark at the least appearance of danger. cyrus harding and his companions followed beside the road the wire which</p>
<p>connected the corral with granite house. after walking for nearly two miles, they had not as yet discovered any explanation</p>
<p>of the difficulty. the posts were in good order, the wire regularly extended. however, at that moment the engineer observed</p>
<p>that the wire appeared to be slack, and on arriving at post no. I4, herbert, who was in advance stopped,</p>
<p>exclaiming, "the wire is broken!" his companions hurried forward and arrived at the spot where the lad was standing. the</p>
<p>post was rooted up and lying across the path. the unexpected explanation of the difficulty was here, and it was</p>
<p>evident that the despatches from granite house had not been received at the corral, nor those from the corral at</p>
<p>granite house. "it wasn t the wind that blew down this post," observed pencroft. "no," replied gideon spilett. "the earth</p>
<p>has been dug, up round its foot, and it has been torn up by the hand of man." "besides, the</p>
<p>wire is broken," added herbert, showing that the wire had been snapped. "is the fracture recent?" asked harding. "yes," answered</p>
<p>herbert, "it has certainly been done quite lately." "to the corral." to the corral!" exclaimed the sailor. the colonists were</p>
<p>now half way between granite house and the corral, having still two miles and a half to go. they pressed</p>
<p>forward with redoubled speed. indeed, it was to be feared that ?ome serious accident had occurred in the corral. no</p>
<p>doubt, ayrton might have sent a telegram which had not arrived, but this was not the rea?on why his companions</p>
<p>were 5I0 uneasy, for, a more unaccountable circumstance, ayrton, who had promised to return the evening before, had not reappeared.</p>
<p>in short, it was not without a motive that all communication had been stopped between the corral and granite house,</p>
<p>and who but the convicts could have any interest in interrupting this communication? the settlers hastened on, their hearts oppressed</p>
<p>with anxiety. they were sincerely attached to their new companion. were they to find him struck down by the hands</p>
<p>of those of whom he was formerly the leader? ?oon they arrived at the place where the road led along</p>
<p>the side of the little stream which flowed from the red creek and watered the meadows of the corral. they</p>
<p>then moderated their pace ?o that they should not be out of breath at the moment when a struggle might</p>
<p>be necessary. their guns were in their hands ready cocked. the forest was watched on every side. top uttered sullen</p>
<p>groans which were rather ominous. at last the palisade appeared through the trees. no trace of any damage could be</p>
<p>seen. the gate was shut as usual. deep silence reigned in the corral. neither the accustomed bleating of the sheep</p>
<p>nor ayrton s voice could be heard. "let us enter," said cyrus harding. and the engineer advanced, while his companions,</p>
<p>keeping watch about twenty paces behind him, were ready to fire at a moment s notice. harding raised the inner</p>
<p>latch of the gate and was about to push it back, when top barked loudly, a report ?ounded and was</p>
<p>responded to by a cry of pain. herbert, struck by a bullet, lay stretched on the ground. at herbert s</p>
<p>cry, pencroft, letting his gun fall, rushed towards him. "they have killed him!" he cried. "my boy! they have killed</p>
<p>him!" cyrus harding and gideon spilett ran to herbert. the reporter listened to ascertain if the poor lad s heart</p>
<p>was still beating. "he lives," said he, "but he must be carried" "to granite house? that is impossible!" replied the</p>
<p>engineer. "into the corral, then!" said pencroft. "in a moment," said harding. and he ran round the left corner of</p>
<p>the palisade. there he found a convict, who aiming at him, sent a ball through his hat. in a few</p>
<p>seconds, before he had even time to fire his second barrel, he fell, struck to the heart by harding s</p>
<p>dagger, more sure even than his gun. during this time, gideon spilett and the sailor hoisted themselves over the palisade,</p>
<p>leaped into the enclosure, threw down the props which supported the inner door, ran into the empty house, and ?oon,</p>
<p>poor herbert was lying on ayrton s bed. in a few moments, harding was by his side. on seeing herbert</p>
<p>senseless, the sailor s grief was terrible. he ?obbed, he cried, he tried to beat his head against the wall.</p>
<p>neither the engineer nor the reporter could calm him. they themselves were choked with emotion. they could not speak. however,</p>
<p>they knew that it depended on them to rescue from death the poor boy who was suffering beneath their eyes.</p>
<p>gideon spilett had not passed through the many incidents by which his life had been checkered without acquiring ?ome</p>
