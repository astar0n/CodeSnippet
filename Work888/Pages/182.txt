<p>of beastly dream which doesn t frighten you because you re part of it, part of the beastliness. no, the</p>
<p>thing that got me, so far, more than anything was--what d you think? a little dog, no bigger than a</p>
<p>kitten, that was run over the other day in the street by a motor-cyclist--and a civilian at that. there were</p>
<p>two or three women round it, crying and gesticulating. it looked as if they d just lifted it out of</p>
<p>a bath of blood. that made me sick. you see, the little dog wasn t in the picture. i hadn</p>
<p>t bargained for him. yet the things morrie saw in south africa--do you remember how he would tell us about</p>
<p>them?--weren t in it with the things that happened here. pounding apart, the things that corpses can do, apparently on</p>
<p>their own, are simply unbelievable--what the war correspondents call "fantastic postures." but i haven t got to the point when</p>
<p>i can slap my thighs, and roar with laughter--if they happen to be germans. in between, the boredom is so</p>
<p>awful that i ve heard some of our men say they d rather have things happening. and, of course, we</p>
<p>re all hoping that when those shells come along there won t be quite so much "between." my darling ronny,--yes,</p>
<p>i think all your letters must have come, because you ve answered everything. you always tell me just what i</p>
<p>want to know. when i see the fat envelopes coming i know they re going to be chock-full of the</p>
<p>things i ve happened to be thinking about. don t let s ever forget to put the dates, because i</p>
<p>make out that i ve always dreamed about you, too, the nights you ve written. and so the aunties are</p>
<p>working in the war hospital supply depﬁt? it s frightfully funny what dorothy says about their enioying the war and</p>
<p>feeling so important. don t let her grudge it them, though; it s all the enioyment, or importance, they re</p>
<p>ever had in their lives, poor dears. but i shall know, if a swab bursts in my inside, that it</p>
<p>s auntie edie s. as for auntie emmeline s, i can t even imagine what they d be like--monstrosities--or little</p>
<p>babies in/"ured at birth. aunt louie s would be well-shaped and firm, but erring a little on the hard side,</p>
<p>don t you think? that reminds me, i suppose i may tell you now since it s been in the</p>
<p>papers, that we ve actually got moving fortresses out here. i haven t seen them yet, but a fellow who</p>
<p>has thinks they must be uncommonly like drayton s and my thing. i suspect, from what he says, they re</p>
<p>a bit better, though. we hadn t got the rocking-horse idea. it s odd--this time last year i should have</p>
<p>gone off my head with agony at the mere thought of anybody getting in before us; and now i don</p>
<p>t care a bit. i do mind rather for drayton s sake, though i don t suppose he cares, either.</p>
<p>the great thing is that it s been done, and done better. anyway we ve been lucky. supposing the germans</p>
<p>had got on to them, and trotted them out first, and one of our own guns had potted him or</p>
<p>me, that would have been a iolly sell. what makes you ask after timmy? i hardly W" £0 3!" You</p>
<p>the awful thing that s happened to him. he had to travel down to the base hospital on a poor</p>
<p>chap who was shivering with shell-shock, and--he never came back again. it doesn t matter, because the weather s so</p>
<p>warm now that i don t want him. but i m sorry because you all gave him to me and</p>
<p>it looks as if i hadn t cared for him. but i did.... /une I0th. sorry i couldn t finish</p>
<p>this last week. things developed rather suddenly. i wish i could tell you what, but we mustn t let on</p>
<p>what happens, not even now, when it s done happening. still, there are all the other things i couldn t</p>
<p>say anything about at the time. if you must know, i ve been up "over the top" three times now</p>
<p>since i came out in february. so, you see, one gets through all right. well--i tried ages ago to tell</p>
<p>dorothy what it was like. it s been like that every time (except that i ve got over the queer</p>
<p>funky feeling half-way through}. it ll be like that again next time, i know. because now i ve tested it.</p>
<p>and, ronny--i couldn t tell dorothy this, because she d think it was all rot--but when you re up first</p>
<p>out of the trench and stand alone on the parapet, it s absolute happiness. and the charge is--well, it s</p>
<p>simply heaven. it s as if you d never really lived till then; i certainly hadn t, not up to</p>
<p>the top-notch, barring those three days we had together. that s why--this part s mostly for michael--there s something rotten</p>
<p>about that poem he sent me that somebody wrote, making out that this gorgeous fight-feeling (which is what i suppose</p>
<p>he s trying for) is nothing but a form of seem-madness. if he thinks that s all there is in</p>
<p>it, he doesn t know much about war, or love either. though i m bound to say there s a</p>
<p>clever chap in my battalion who thinks the same thing. he says he feels the ecstasy, or whatever it is,</p>
<p>all right, just the same as i do; but that it s simply submerged savagery bobbing up to the top--a</p>
<p>hidden lust for killing, and the hidden memory of having killed, he called it. he s always ashamed of it</p>
<p>the next day, as if he had been drunk. and my sergeant-ma/"or, bless him, says there s nothing in it</p>
<p>but "a ration of rum." can t be that in my case because i always give mine to a</p>
<p></p>
