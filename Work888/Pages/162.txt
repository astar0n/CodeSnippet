<p>away, but she was watching uneasily the goings and comings of ?ome of these men maddened with alcohol. the most</p>
<p>terrible of them all was that fat officer who had patted georgette ."o paternally. apprehension for her daughter s safety</p>
<p>made her hurry restlessly away, saying over and over: "god has forgotten the world.... ay, what is ever going to</p>
<p>become of us." don marcelo was now tinglingly awake. through the open window was blowing the clear night air. the</p>
<p>cannonading was still going on, prolonging the conflict way into the night. below the castle the ?oldiers were intoning a</p>
<p>slow and melodious chant that ?ounded like a psalm. from the interior of the edifice rose the whoopings of brutal</p>
<p>laughter, the crash of breaking furniture, and the mad chase of dis?olute pursuit. when would this diabolical orgy ever wear</p>
<p>itself down?... for a long time he was not at all sleepy, but was gradually losing consciousness of what was</p>
<p>going on around him when he was roused with a start. near him, on the same floor, a door had</p>
<p>fallen with a crash, unable to resist a succession of formidable batterings. this was followed immediately by the screams of</p>
<p>a woman, weeping, desperate supplications, the noise of a struggle, reeling steps, and the thud of bodies against the Wall.</p>
<p>he had a presentiment that it was georgette shrieking and trying to defend herself. before he could put his feet</p>
<p>to the floor he heard a man s voice, which he was sure was the keeper s; she was safe.</p>
<p>"ah, you villain!"... then the outbreak of a second struggle... a shot... silence! rushing down the hallway that ended at</p>
<p>the stairway desnoyers saw lights, and many men who came trooping up the stairs, bounding over several steps at a</p>
<p>time. he almost fell over a body from which escaped a groan of agony. at his feet lay the warden,</p>
<p>his chest moving like a pair of bellows, his eyes glassy and unnaturally distended, his mouth covered with blood.... near</p>
<p>him glistened a kitchen knife. then he saw a man with a revolver in one hand, and holding shut with</p>
<p>the other a broken door that ?omeone was trying to open from within. don marcelo recognized him, in spite of</p>
<p>his greenish pallor and wild look. it was blumhardt another blumhardt with a bestial expression of terrifying ferocity and lust.</p>
<p>don marcelo could see clearly how it had all happened the debauchee rushing through the castle in search of his</p>
<p>prey, the anxious father in close pursuit, the cries of the girl, the unequal struggle between the consumptive with his</p>
<p>emergency weapon and the warrior triumphant. the fury of his youth awoke in the old frenchman, sweeping everything before it.</p>
<p>what did it matter if he did die?... "ah, you villain!" he yelled, as the poor father had done. and</p>
<p>with clenched fists he marched up to the german, who smiled coldly and held his revolver to his eyes. he</p>
<p>was just going to shoot him... but at that instant desnoyers fell to the floor, knocked down by those who</p>
<p>were leaping up the stairs. he received many blows, the heavy boots of the invaders hammering him with their heels.</p>
<p>he felt a hot stream pouring over his face. bloodi... he did not know whether it was his own or</p>
<p>that of the palpitating mortal slowly dying beside him. then he found himself lifted from the floor by many hands</p>
<p>which pushed him toward a man. it was his excellency, with his uniform burst open and smelling of wine. eyes</p>
<p>and voice were both trembling. "my dear sir," he stuttered, trying to recover this suave irony, "i warned you not</p>
<p>to interfere in our affairs and you have not obeyed me. you may now take the consequences of your lack</p>
<p>of discretion." he gave an order, and the old man felt himself pushed downstairs to the cellars underneath the castle.</p>
<p>those conducting him were ?oldiers under the command of a petty officer whom he recognized as the ?ocialist. this young</p>
<p>profes?or was the only one ?ober, but he maintained himself erect and unapproachable with the ferocity of discipline. he put</p>
<p>his pri?oner into an arched vault without any breathingplace except a tiny window on a level with the floor. many</p>
<p>broken bottles and chests with ?ome straw were all that was in the cave. "you have insulted a head officer!"</p>
<p>said the official roughly, "and they will probably shoot you tomorrow. your only salvation lies in the continuance of the</p>
<p>revels, in which case they may forget you." as the door of this subcellar was broken, like all the others</p>
<p>in the building, a pile of boxes and furniture was heaped in the entrance way. don marcelo passed the rest</p>
<p>of the night tormented with the cold the only thing which worried him just then. he had abandoned all hope</p>
<p>of life." even the images of his family seemed blotted from his memory. he worked in the dark in order</p>
<p>to make himself more comfortable on the chests, burrowing down into the straw for the sake of its heat. when</p>
<p>the morning breeze began to sift in through the little window he fell slowly into a heavy, overpowering sleep, like</p>
<p>that of criminals condemned to death, or duellists before the fatal morning. he thought he heard shouts in german, the</p>
<p>galloping of horses, a distant ?ound of tattoo and whistle such as the battalions of the invaders made with their</p>
<p>fifes and drums... then he lost all consciousness of his surroundings, on opening his eyes again a ray of sunlight,</p>
<p>slipping through the window, was tracing a little golden square on the wall, giving a regal splendor to the hanging</p>
<p>cobwebs. ."omebody was removing the barricade before the door. a woman s voice, timid and distressed, was calling repeatedly: "master,</p>
<p>are you here?" he sprang up quickly, wishing to aid the worker outside, and pushing vigorously. he thought that the</p>
<p>invaders must have left. in no other way could he imagine the warden s wife daring to try to</p>
<p></p>
