<p>over the city, as to the splendor of our public and common life as compared with the simplicity of our</p>
<p>private and home life, and the contrast which, in this respect, the twentieth bears to the nineteenth century. to save</p>
<p>ourselves useless burdens, we have as little gear about us at home as is consistent with comfort, but the social</p>
<p>side of our life is ornate and luxurious beyond anything the world ever knew before. all the industrial and professional</p>
<p>guilds have clubhouses as extensive as this, as well as country, mountain, and seaside houses for sport and rest in</p>
<p>vacations." note. in the latter part of the nineteenth century it became a practice of needy young men at some</p>
<p>of the colleges of the country to earn a little money for their term bills by serving as waiters on</p>
<p>tables at hotels during the long summer vacation. it was claimed, in reply to critics who expressed the preiudices of</p>
<p>the time in asserting that persons voluntarily following such an occupation could not be gentlemen, that they were entitled to</p>
<p>praise for vindicating, by their example, the dignity of all honest and necessary labor. the use of this argument illustrates</p>
<p>a common confusion in thought on the part of my former contemporaries. the business of waiting on tables was in</p>
<p>no more need of defense than most of the other ways of getting a living in that day, but to</p>
<p>talk of dignity attaching to labor of any sort under the system then prevailing was absurd. there is no way</p>
<p>in which selling labor for the highest price it will fetch is more dignified than selling goods for what can</p>
<p>be got. both were commercial transactions to be iudged by the commercial standard. by setting a price in money on</p>
<p>his service, the worker accepted the money measure for it, and renounced all clear claim to be judged by any</p>
<p>other. the sordid taint which this necessity imparted to the noblest and the highest sorts of service was bitterly resented</p>
<p>by generous souls, but there was no evading it, there was no exemption, however transcendent the quality of one s</p>
<p>service, from the necessity of haggling for its price in the market-place. the physician must sell his healing and the</p>
<p>apostle his preaching like the rest. the prophet, who had guessed the meaning of god, must dicker for the price</p>
<p>of the revelation, and the poet hawk his visions in printers row. if i were asked to name the most</p>
<p>distinguishing felicity of this age, as compared to that in which i first saw the light, i should say that</p>
<p>to me it seems to consist in the dignity you have given to labor by refusing to set a price</p>
<p>upon it and abolishing the market-place forever. by requiring of every man his best you have made god his task-meater,</p>
<p>and by making honor the sole reward of achievement you have imparted to all service the distinction peculiar in my</p>
<p>day to the soldier s. when, in the course of our tour of inspection, we came to the library, we</p>
<p>succumbed to the temptation of the luxurious leather chairs with which it was furnished, and sat down in one of</p>
<p>the book-lined alcoves to rest and chat awhile i cannot sufficiently celebrate the glorious liberty that reigns in the public</p>
<p>libraries of the twentieth century as compared with the intolerable management of those of the nineteenth century, in which the</p>
<p>books were iealously railed away from the people, and obtainable only at an expenditure of time and red tape calculated</p>
<p>to discourage any ordinary taste for literature. "edith tells me that you have been in the library all the morning,"</p>
<p>said mrs. leete. "do you know, it seems to me, mr. west, that you are the most enviable of mortals."</p>
<p>"i should like to know just why," i replied. "because the books of the last hundred years will be new</p>
<p>to you," she answered. "you will have so much of the most absorbing literature to read as to leave you</p>
<p>scarcely time for meals these five years to come. ah, what would i give if i had not already read</p>
<p>berrian s novels." "or nesmyth s, mamma," added edith. "yes, or oates poems, or "past and present, or, "in the</p>
<p>beginning, or--oh, i could name a dozen books, each worth a year of one s life," declared mrs. leete, enthusiastically,</p>
<p>"i fudge, then, that there has been some notable literature produced in this century." "yes," said dr. leete. "it has</p>
<p>been an era of unexampled intellectual splendor. probably humanity never before passed through a moral and material evolution, at once</p>
<p>so vast in its scope and brief in its time of accomplishment, as that from the old order to the</p>
<p>new in the early part of this century. when men came to realize the greatness of the felicity which had</p>
<p>befallen them, and that the change through which they had passed was not merely an improvement in details of their</p>
<p>condition, but the rise of the race to a new plane of existence with an illimitable vista of progress, their</p>
<p>minds were affected in all their faculties with a stimulus, of which the outburst of the mediaeval renaissance offers a</p>
<p>suggestion but faint indeed. there ensued an era of mechanical invention, scientific discovery, art, musical and literary productiveness to which</p>
<p>no previous age of the world offers anything comparable." "by the way," said i, "talking of literature, how are books</p>
<p>published now? is that also done by the nation?" "but how do you manage it? does the government publish everything</p>
<p>that is brought it as a matter of course, at the public expense, or does it exercise a censorship and</p>
<p>print only what it approves?" "neither way. the printing department has no censorial powers. it is bound to print all</p>
<p>that is offered it, but prints it only on condition that the author defray the first cost out of his</p>
<p>credit. he must pay for the privilege of the public ear, and if he has any message worth hearing</p>
