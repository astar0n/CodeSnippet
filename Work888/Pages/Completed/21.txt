<p>mark my words. we re way ahead of them and that s ninety percent of the battle." "thanks guys. we</p>
<p>just don t want to be the cause of more problems," says jay. "don t worry about a thing. we</p>
<p>can handle it," says david. the meeting breaks up and jay and mike go back to their apartment. mike says,</p>
<p>"i m still worried. what if something should go wrong and they actually do bomb the place?" "i know. i</p>
<p>think we should keep our eyes open and if things look bad, we clear out of here quick and let</p>
<p>jack know we re on the move. i don t want to do anything that would get anyone else hurt,"</p>
<p>says jay. "i agree. but if we do make a run for it, no canaries." "oh yeah? we ll see</p>
<p>about that." mark and sid sit in their car parked a block up the street from the club eating their</p>
<p>burgers and watching the loading dock. several trucks arrive and off load supplies. a little after two o clock a</p>
<p>beer delivery truck pulls up. the name on the side says arrowmark distributing.a driver with a clipboard gets out and</p>
<p>goes in the club. a few minutes later he returns and begins offloading kegs of beer, delivering them and returning</p>
<p>with the empties. they count the kegs, ten in all. mark has a pair of binoculars and sees that they</p>
<p>re all millers, the name he remembers seeing on the taps inside. that s the house beer. eventually the driver</p>
<p>closes up the truck and returns to the club with his clipboard. a few minutes later, he s back, gets</p>
<p>in the truck, cranks up the diesel and rumbles off. mark and sid follow. a few blocks away, he pulls</p>
<p>up to a bar and grill and goes inside. mark and sid pull up and park a hundred feet away.</p>
<p>sid says, "see that? no clipboard and be locked the door to the cab. this doesn t look like a</p>
<p>delivery. this might be our chance to talk to him. let s go." "yeah, and that place is more like</p>
<p>a restaurant. must be a late lunch." they hop out of the car and quickly jog up the street, sid</p>
<p>pretends to look at the menu in the window while mark stays to one side. inside, sid sees the driver</p>
<p>sitting at the bar with a menu. sid says, "yep, he s ordering food. let s go." they enter and</p>
<p>head to the bar. there are stools to the right of the driver. they take off their coats and hang</p>
<p>them on hooks near the door. mark goes over and sits next to the driver while sid sits next to</p>
<p>mark. mark signals the bartender and says, "couple a beers and some onion rings?" sid says, across mark, "say buddy,</p>
<p>is that your truck outside?" the driver, drinking a cup of coffee looks over and says, "yeah, it not blocking</p>
<p>anything, is it?" "no, no, i was just curious, how much does one of those weigh when it s fully</p>
<p>loaded? i ll bet that beer weighs a whole lot?" "yep it s pretty heavy. one of those kegs alone</p>
<p>weighs over a hundred sixty pounds. but the truck weight is limited by zoning. usually not more than ten tons."</p>
<p>"must take a pretty big engine?" "oh, yeah, big old cummins diesel." "you been driving for long?" "no, i m</p>
<p>just filling in today for a guy on vacation. i normally drive a package delivery truck." "you ever deliver to</p>
<p>that big dance club a couple a blocks east of here? i ll bet they take a lot of beer?"</p>
<p>"oh yeah, just stopped there. ten kegs of millers on monday and wednesday and twelve on friday. they sure do</p>
<p>go through an awful lot of it." "sure sounds that way. you say monday, wednesday friday, so, is it pretty</p>
<p>much always the same route?" "oh yeah. well the truck does the same route, anyway. but i just do this</p>
<p>on monday through wednesday. some ohure guy does the rest of the week. but yeah, with a truck that long,</p>
<p>you don t have a lot of flexibility. i go one route monday and wednesday and anohure on tuesday. not</p>
<p>a lot of variety except when the city tear; up the street." "yeah, i guess with a load like that</p>
<p>you gotta know the way. not a lot of room to back up, i guess?" "no, that s not a</p>
<p>good idea." "hey, it s been nice talking to you. we gotta run," says mark as he and sid finish</p>
<p>their beers. they get up, get their coats and head outside where mark says, "i need to get in that</p>
<p>truck and look at the clipboard. that ll have his exact schedule on it." they quickly jimmy the truck s</p>
<p>door lock and grab the clipboard that s sitting on the passenger seat. mark scans it while sid acts as</p>
<p>lookout. after a few seconds, mark says, "i got it. we need to pay a visit to mack s grill.</p>
<p>it s the stop before the dance club." they drive a few blocks away and park and go into mack</p>
<p>s. once inside the nearly empty place, they sit at the bar and order two more beers. mark casually asks</p>
<p>the bartender, "i ll bet the snow makes it hard to get beer deliveries?" "nah, they re as regular as</p>
<p>clock work, snow or no snow every monday, wednesday and friday at 1:30." "i guess beer s too important," laughs</p>
<p>sid. the bartender laughs and says, "you got that right." after a while, they finish their beers and leave. back</p>
<p>in their car, sid says, "geez that was easy." mark says, "right about that. now let s go get a</p>
<p>couple of six packs and take a break," as they head for their motel. the next morning, mark calls joe</p>
<p>from his cell phone and says, "we got that information you wanted. the distributer is arrowmark distributing and they</p>
