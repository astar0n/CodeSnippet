<p>to come as to be scarcely aware of present anguish. but scott was merciful. he withdrew the probe and very</p>
<p>pitifully he closed the wound that he had opened. "no, no!" he said. "that has nothing to do with me--or</p>
<p>with eustace either. but it makes your case absolutely plain. come with me now--before you feel any worse about it--and</p>
<p>ask him to give you your release!" "oh, scott!" she looked up at him at last, and though there was</p>
<p>a measure of relief in her eyes, her face was deathly. "oh, scott,--dare i do that?" "i shall be there,"</p>
<p>he said. "yes,--yes, you will be there! you won t leave me? promise!" she clasped his arm in entreaty. he</p>
<p>looked into her eyes, and there was a great kindness in his own---the kindness of greatheart arming himself to defend</p>
<p>his pilgrims. "yes, i promise that," he said, adding, "unless i leave you at your own desire." "you will never</p>
<p>do that," dinah said and smiled with quivering lips. "you are good to me. oh, you are good! but--but--" "but</p>
<p>what?" he questioned gently. "he may refuse to set me free," she said desperately. "what then?" "my dear, no one</p>
<p>is married by force now-a-days," he said. her face changed as a sudden memory swept across her. "and my mother!</p>
<p>my mother!" she said. "don t you think we had better deal with one difficulty at a time?" suggested scott.</p>
<p>his hand sought hers, he drew her to her feet. and, as one having no choice, she submitted and went</p>
<p>with him. it was still raining, but the heaviest of the shower was over. a gleam of sunshine lit the</p>
<p>distance as they went, and a faint, faint ray of hope dawned in dinah s heart at the sight. though</p>
<p>her deliverance was yet to be achieved, though she dreaded unspeakably that which lay before her, at least the door</p>
<p>was open, could she but reach it to pass through. she breathed a purer air already. and beside her stood</p>
<p>greatheart the valiant, covering her with his shield of gold. a large and merry party of guests were congregated in</p>
<p>the great hall at perrythorpe court, having tea. one of them--a young soldier-cousin of the studleys--was singing a sentimental ditty</p>
<p>at a piano to which no one was listening; and the hubbub was considerable. dinah, admitted into the outer hall</p>
<p>that was curtained off from the gay crowd, shrank nearer to scott as the cheery tumult reached her. "need we--must</p>
<p>we--go in that way?" she whispered. there was a door on the right of the porch. scott turned towards it.</p>
<p>"i suppose we can go in there?" he said to the man who had admitted them. "the gun-room, sir? yes,</p>
<p>if you wish, sir. shall i bring tea?" "no," scott said quietly. "find sir eustace studley if you can, and</p>
<p>ask him to join us there! come along, dinah!" his hand touched her arm. she entered the little room as</p>
<p>one seeking refuge. it led into a conservatory, and thence to the garden. the apartment itself was given up entirely</p>
<p>to weapons or instruments of sport, guns, fishing-rods, hunting-stocks, golf-clubs, tennis-rackets, were stored in various racks and stands. a smell</p>
<p>of stale cigar-smoke pervaded it. colonel de vigne was wont to retire hither at night in preference to the less</p>
<p>cosy and intimate smoking-room. but there was no one here now, and scott laid hat and riding-whip upon the table</p>
<p>and drew forward a chair for his companion. she looked at him and tried to thank him, but she was</p>
<p>voiceless. her pale lips moved without sound. scott s eyes were very kindly. "don t be so frightened, child!" he</p>
<p>said; and then, a sudden thought striking him, "look here! you go and wait in the conservatory and let me</p>
<p>speak to him first! yes, that will be the best way. come!" his hand touched her again. she turned as</p>
<p>one compelled. but as he opened the glass door, she found her voice. "oh, i ought not to--to let you</p>
<p>face him alone. i must be brave. i must." "yes, you must," scott answered. "but i will see him alone</p>
<p>first. it will make it easier for everyone." yet for a moment she halted still. "you really mean it? you</p>
<p>wish it?" "yes, i wish it," he said. "wait in here till i call you!" she took him at his</p>
<p>word. there was no other course. he closed the door upon her and turned back alone. he sat down in</p>
<p>the chair that he had placed for her and became motionless as a figure carved in bronze. his pale face</p>
<p>and trim, colourless beard were in shadow, his eyes were lowered. there was scarcely an inanimate obiect in the room</p>
<p>as insignificant and unimposing as he, and yet in his stillness, in his utter unobtrusiveness, there lay a strength such</p>
<p>as the strongest knight who ever rode in armour might have envied. there came a careless step without, a hand</p>
<p>upon the door. it opened, and sir eustace, handsome, self-assured, slightly haughty, strode into the room. "hullo, stumpy! what do</p>
<p>you want? i can t stop. i am booked to play billiards with miss de vigne. a test match to</p>
<p>demonstrate the steadiness of my nerves!" scott stood up. "i have a bigger test for you than that, old chap,"</p>
<p>he said. "shut the door if you don t mind!" sir eustace sent him a swift, edged glance. "i can</p>
<p>t stop," he said again. "what is it? some mare s nest about isabel?" "no, nothing whatever to do with</p>
<p>isabel. shut the door, man! i must be alone with you for a few minutes." scott spoke with unwonted vehemence.</p>
<p>the careless notes of the piano, the merry tumult of chattering voices, seemed to affect him oddly, almost to exasperate</p>
<p>him. sir eustace turned and swung the door shut; then with less than his customary arrogance he came to scott.</p>
<p>"what s the matter?" he said. "out with it! don t break the news if you can help it!"</p>
