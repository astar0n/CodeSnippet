<p>and the guys were banging the cans into the back. "shhh." she reached to quiet her. "we re almost there,</p>
<p>baby." then she tugged at her leash and settled her back into the seat. since the rain was all but</p>
<p>over, she decided to park the car where she dropped knickers off and then walk over to her office, which</p>
<p>was only a couple of blocks east. she found a spot right next to the awning of pooch pros, and</p>
<p>the minute knickers was liberated from the car, she bounded to the door dragging her leash through the puddles. misha</p>
<p>was already there to meet her. "come on, my kraceve baby, my beauty." he reached down and gave her a</p>
<p>big hug, misha was a gaunt, balding, blond-haired russian who had once been the hero of the soviet olympic swim</p>
<p>team. now he looked like he could stand a piroshki or two to plump him up. "you be big fluff</p>
<p>of cloud after we finishing." ally followed them in, and there was betty. ally figured "betty" assumed her made-up but</p>
<p>totally american name was easier than whatever she d used in russia, but to ally it just felt weird betty</p>
<p>had dark hair, a broad smile that wouldn t die, and approximately thirty pounds that would have looked better on</p>
<p>misha. they reminded her of jack sprat, et al. "honey, there is problem at your office. woman name jennifer call.</p>
<p>say she try reach you at home but you leave already. and you don t answer your cell phone." "shit,</p>
<p>i turned it off. knickers goes nuts if it rings in the car." jennifer was only a couple of years</p>
<p>older than ally, but she d been with the firm back when ally s father, arthur, ran it and she</p>
<p>was the mother figure of citispace. she was also ally s best friend and had been even before ally came</p>
<p>back to run the firm. ally felt like she had known her forever. these days jen spent a lot of</p>
<p>effort trying to create a social life for ally that would include eligible men. she kept nagging her to join</p>
<p>some clubs, anything, just get out there. ally knew she was right, but she was working too hard to take</p>
<p>time out. she had the idea, which she wasn t naive enough to actually believe at a rational level, that</p>
<p>sooner or later someone who could replace steve would come along. yes, she was lonely a lot, but until this</p>
<p>last deterioration of her heart she d spent a lot of evenings and weekends outside, biking and hiking around town,</p>
<p>and she knew plenty of people who were interesting and kind. she sometimes thought her problem was that she liked</p>
<p>people, all kinds of people, as long as they were kept slightly away, at a psychic distance. maybe it was</p>
<p>the getting close part that never seemed to work out. it had actually been that way ever since steve disappeared.</p>
<p>she had the premonition that if she got too close to somebody, she was destined to lose them. now she</p>
<p>stood for a second, puzzling. she d mentioned taking knickers to pooch pros, so that s how jen knew where</p>
<p>she d be, but what could have gone wrong at 7:45 in the morning? jennifer wasn t usually in this</p>
<p>early, but she was finishing a rush job for a marble bathroom for a couple on the upper east side.</p>
<p>on days when jennifer did get to the office first, she d have the coffee going and an extra bagel</p>
<p>for knickers, on the chance ally might bring her, which she often did. but to phone betty just to tell</p>
<p>her to hurry? that was odd. "should i call now?" it seemed pointless. she was no more than ten minutes</p>
<p>away. what else could go wrong in ten minutes? "she sound very hurry," betty declared. ally took her cell phone</p>
<p>out of her bag and switched it on. the office rang only once and then jennifer was there. "ally, you</p>
<p>re not going to believe who called here ten minutes ago, asking for you. winston bartlett. my god, it s</p>
<p>like donald trump called. well, actually it was some male secretary or something. he said he was calling to confirm</p>
<p>your ten o clock appointment. at an address on gramercy park east. what s that about? jesus, ally, where are</p>
<p>you? i don t know what you re up to, but this could be big. he owns entire buildings, for</p>
<p>chrissake." "did you say i was coming?" "i didn t know what to say. he left a number to call</p>
<p>if you can t make it. otherwise, he ll assume you ll be there. it s only two hours from</p>
<p>now." "all right, jen, let s put together a folio of our biggest iobs. lead with that gut rehab we</p>
<p>did on the building down by the south street seaport. and put in those two floor-through lofts we did on</p>
<p>that conversion in tribeca. the ones with the slate bathrooms and the stainless-steel countertops in the kitchen." "i ve already</p>
<p>started. do you know specifically what he has in mind?" she paused. "how did he find out about us, anyway?"</p>
<p>"my creepy kid brother works for him." she sighed. "it s a long story. be there in a couple of</p>
<p>minutes." she clicked off the phone. "betty, thanks a lot. i ve gotta run." she turned and gave knickers a</p>
<p>last rumple of the ears. "be good, baby, i ll pick you up by six at the latest." "what wrong?"</p>
<p>misha was concerned, twisting a white towel he was holding. "big problem?" "nothing s wrong. actually, something probably is wrong.</p>
<p>i just don t know what it is yet." she headed out the door. the design firm her father had</p>
<p>started and she d kept going, now with some architecture thrown in, was on the ground floor of an old</p>
<p>industrial loft building whose upper floors had been converted into rental apartments in the early 1980s. the owner was</p>
