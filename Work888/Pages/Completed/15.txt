<p>had been weeping for him made him relent. he put an arm around her and drew her to him. "don</p>
<p>t cry, honey," he said. "it makes me unhappy to see you miserable." he kissed her. and they clung together,</p>
<p>finding a little comfort in the contact of warm young bodies. he went up to her room that night. he</p>
<p>was more anxious as to rudolph than he cared to admit, but he went up, treading ?oftly on stairs that</p>
<p>creaked with every step. he had no coherent thoughts. he wanted companionship rather than love. he was hungry for what</p>
<p>she gave him, the touch of her hands about his neck, the sense of his manhood that shone from her</p>
<p>faithful eyes, the admiration and unstinting love she offered him. but alone in the little room he had a reaction,</p>
<p>not the less keen because it was his fastidious rather than his moral sense that revolted. the room was untidy,</p>
<p>close, ?ordid. even anna s youth did not redeem it. again he had the sense, when he had closed the</p>
<p>door, of being caught in a trap, and this time a dirty trap. when she had taken off her hat,</p>
<p>and held up her face to be kissed, he knew he would not stay. "it s awful, isn t it?"</p>
<p>she asked, following his eyes. "it doesn t look like you. that s sure." "i hurried out. it s not</p>
<p>?o bad when it s tidy." he threw up the window, and stood there a moment. the spring air was</p>
<p>cool and clean, and there was a ?ound of tramping feet below. he looked down. the railway station was nearby,</p>
<p>and marching toward it, with the long swing of regulars, a company of ?oldiers was moving rapidly. the night, the</p>
<p>absence of drums or music, the businesslike rapidity of their progress, held him there, looking down, he turned around. anna</p>
<p>had slipped off her coat, and had opened the collar of her blouse. her neck gleamed white and young. she</p>
<p>smiled at him. "i guess i ll be going," he stammered. "going!" "i only wanted to see how you are</p>
<p>fixed." his eyes evaded hers. "i ll see you again in a day or two. i " he could not</p>
<p>tell her the thoughts that were surging in him. the country was at war. those fellows below there were already</p>
<p>in it, of it. and here in this ?ordid room, he had meant to take her, not because he loved</p>
<p>her, but because she offered herself. it was cheap. it was terrible. it was dirty. "good night," he said, and</p>
<p>tried to kiss her. but she turned her face away. she stood listening to his steps on the stairs as</p>
<p>he went down, steps that mingled and were lost in the steady tramp of the ?oldiers feet in the street</p>
<p>below. with his many new problems following the declaration of war, clayton spencer found a certain peace. it was good</p>
<p>to work hard. it was good to fill every working hour, and to drop into sleep at night too weary</p>
<p>for consecutive thought. yet had he been frank with himself he would have acknowledged that audrey was never really out</p>
<p>of his mind. back of his every decision lay his desire for her approval. he did not make them with</p>
<p>her consciously in his mind, but he wanted her to know and understand, in his determination, for instance, to offer</p>
<p>his shells to the government at a nominal profit, there was no desire to win her approbation. it was rather</p>
<p>that he felt her behind him in the decision. he shrank from telling natalie. indeed, until he had returned from</p>
<p>washington he did not broach the sublect. and then he was tired and rather discouraged, and as a result almost</p>
<p>brutally abrupt. coming on top of a hard fight with the new directorate, a fight which he had finally won,</p>
<p>washington was disheartening. planning enormously for the future it seemed to have no vision for the things of the present.</p>
<p>he was met vaguely, put off, questioned. he waited hours, as patiently as he could, to find that no man</p>
<p>seemed to have power to act, or to know what powers he had. he found ?omething else, too a suspicion</p>
<p>of him, of his motives. who offered ?omething for nothing must be actuated by ?ome deep and hidden motive. he</p>
<p>found his plain proposition probed and searched for ?ome ulterior purpose behind it. "it s the old distrust, mr. spencer,"</p>
<p>said hutchin?on, who had gone with him to furnish figures and various data. "the democrats are opposed to capital. they</p>
<p>re afraid of it, and the army thinks all civilians are on the make which is pretty nearly true." he</p>
<p>saw the secretary of war, finally, and came away feeling better. he had found there an understanding that a man</p>
<p>may even should make sacrifices for his country during war. but, although he carried away with him the conviction that</p>
<p>his offer would ultimately be accepted, there was nothing actually accomplished. he sent hutchin?on back, and waited for a day</p>
<p>or two, convinced that his very sincerity must bring a concrete result, and ?oon. then, lunching alone one day in</p>
<p>the shoreham, he saw audrey valentine at another table. he had not seen her for weeks, and he had an</p>
<p>odd moment of breathlessness when his eyes fell on her. she was pale and thin, and her eyes looked very</p>
<p>tired. his first impulse was to go to her. the second, on which he acted, was to watch her for</p>
<p>a little, to fill his eyes for the long months of emptiness ahead. she was with a man in uniform,</p>
<p>a young man, gay and smiling. he was paying her evident court, in a debonair fashion, bending toward her across</p>
<p>the table. suddenly clayton was iealous, fiercely jealous. the jealousy of the young is sad enough, but it is an</p>
<p>ephemeral thing. life calls from many directions. there is always the future, and the things of the future. and</p>
