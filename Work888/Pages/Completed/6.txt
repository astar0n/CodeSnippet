<p>not inhabited ; when I shall bring up the deep upon thee, and great waters shall cover thee ; when</p>
<p>I shall bring thee down with them that descend into the pit, with the people of old time, and shall</p>
<p>set thee in the low parts of the earth, in places desolate of old, with them that go down to</p>
<p>the pit, that thou be not inhabited ; and I shall set glory in the land of the living ;</p>
<p>I will make thee a terror, and thou shalt be no more : though thou be sought for, yet shalt</p>
<p>thou never be found again, saith the Lord God. 27 The word of the Lord came again unto me, saying,</p>
<p>Now, thou son of man, take up a lamentation for Tyrus ; and say unto Tyrus, O thou that art</p>
<p>situate at the entry of the sea, which art a merchant of the people for many isles, Thus saith the</p>
<p>Lord God ; O Tyrus, thou hast said, I am of perfect beauty. Thy borders are in the midst of</p>
<p>the seas, thy builders have perfected thy beauty. They have made all thy ship boards of fir trees of Senir</p>
<p>: they have taken cedars from Lebanon to make masts for thee. Of the oaks of Bashan have they made</p>
<p>thine oars ; the company of the Ashurites have made thy benches of ivory, brought out of the isles of</p>
<p>Chittim. 17 18 19 20 21 1 2 3 4 5 6 1813 Ezekiel 27 Fine linen with broidered work</p>
<p>from Egypt was that which thou spreadest forth to be thy sail ; blue and purple from the isles of</p>
<p>Elishah was that which covered thee. The inhabitants of Zidon and Arvad were thy mariners : thy wise men, O</p>
<p>Tyrus, that were in thee, were thy pilots. The ancients of Gebal and the wise men thereof were in thee</p>
<p>thy calkers : all the ships of the sea with their mariners were in thee to occupy thy merchandise. They</p>
<p>of Persia and of Lud and of Phut were in thine army, thy men of war : they hanged the</p>
<p>shield and helmet in thee ; they set forth thy comeliness. The men of Arvad with thine army were upon</p>
<p>thy walls round about, and the Gammadim were in thy towers : they hanged their shields upon thy walls round</p>
<p>about ; they have made thy beauty perfect. Tarshish was thy merchant by reason of the multitude of all kind</p>
<p>of riches ; with silver, iron, tin, and lead, they traded in thy fairs. Javan, Tubal, and Meshech, they were</p>
<p>thy merchants : they traded the persons of men and vessels of brass in thy market. They of the house</p>
<p>of Togarmah traded in thy fairs with horses and horsemen and mules. The men of Dedan were thy merchants ;</p>
<p>many isles were the merchandise of thine hand : they brought thee for a present, horns of ivory and ebony.</p>
<p>Syria was thy merchant by reason of the multitude of the wares of thy making : they occupied in thy</p>
<p>fairs with emeralds, purple, and broidered work, and fine linen, and coral, and agate. Judah, and the land of Israel,</p>
<p>they were thy merchants : they traded in thy market wheat of Minnith, and Pannag, and honey, and oil, and</p>
<p>balm. Damascus was thy merchant in the multitude of the wares of thy making, for the multitude of all riches</p>
<p>; in the wine of Helbon, and white wool. Dan also and iiavan going to and fro occupied in thy</p>
<p>fairs : bright iron, cassia, and calamus, were in thy market. 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15</p>
<p>16 17 18 19 1814 Ezekiel 27 Dedan was thy merchant in precious clothes for chariots. Arabia, and all the</p>
<p>princes of Kedar, they occupied with thee in lambs, and rams, and goats : in these were they thy merchants.</p>
<p>The merchants of Sheba and Raamah, they were thy merchants : they occupied in thy fairs with chief of all</p>
<p>spices, and with all precious stones, and gold. Haran, and Canneh, and Eden, the merchants of Sheba, Asshur, and Chilmad,</p>
<p>were thy merchants. These were thy merchants in all sorts of things, in blue clothes, and broidered work, and in</p>
<p>chests of rich apparel, bound with cords, and made of cedar, among thy merchandise. The ships of Tarshish did sing</p>
<p>of thee in thy market : and thou wast replenished, and made very glorious in the midst of the seas.</p>
<p>Thy rowers have brought thee into great waters : the east wind hath broken thee in the midst of the</p>
<p>seas. Thy riches, and thy fairs, thy merchandise, thy mariners, and thy pilots, thy calkers, and the occupiers of thy</p>
<p>merchandise, and all thy men of war, that are in thee, and in all thy company which is in the</p>
<p>midst of thee, shall fall into the midst of the seas in the day of thy ruin. The suburbs shall</p>
<p>shake at the sound of the cry of thy pilots. And all that handle the oar, the mariners, and all</p>
<p>the pilots of the sea, shall come down from their ships, they shall stand upon the land ; and shall</p>
<p>cause their voice to be heard against thee, and shall cry bitterly, and shall cast up dust upon their heads,</p>
<p>they shall wallow themselves in the ashes ; and they shall make themselves utterly bald for thee, and gird them</p>
<p>with sackcloth, and they shall weep for thee with bitterness of heart and bitter wailing. And in their wailing they</p>
<p>shall take up a lamentation for thee, and lament over thee, saying, what city is like Tyrus, like the destroyed</p>
<p>in the midst of the sea ? 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32</p>
<p>1815 Ezekiel 28 When thy wares went forth out of the seas, thou filledst many people ; thou didst enrich</p>
<p>the kings of the earth with the multitude of thy riches and of thy merchandise. In the time when thou</p>
<p>shalt be broken by the seas in the depths of the waters, thy merchandise and all thy company in the</p>
<p>midst of thee shall fall. All the inhabitants of the isles shall be astonished at thee, and their kings shall</p>
<p>be sore afraid, they shall be troubled in their countenance. The merchants among the people shall hiss at thee ;</p>
<p>thou shalt be a terror, and never shalt be any more. 28 The word of the Lord came again unto</p>
<p>me, saying, Son of man, say unto the prince of Tyrus, Thus saith the Lord God ; Because thine</p>
