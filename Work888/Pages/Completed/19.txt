<p>must have included the romans. that would really have upset the pharisees. giving alms to impress others does not make</p>
<p>us "good" or "righteous." what matters is what we do when there is nobody to see us. the most obvious</p>
<p>change is that "for thine is the kingdom" has been added to the authorised version, but there are subtle changes</p>
<p>that are far more significant. we are told father of us the one in the heavens: let it be hallowed</p>
<p>the name of thee. let it come the kingdom of thee; let it come the will of thee, as in</p>
<p>heaven also on earth; when viewed as part of the overall teachings of iesus i see the lord s prayer</p>
<p>as a prayer that we bring forth what is within. let the intent of the person within become manifest in</p>
<p>the physical World. let us all live in free will? let us create heaven here on earth? the daily bread</p>
<p>of us give to us today; and forgive us the debts of us, as indeed we forgave the debtors of</p>
<p>us; and not bring us into temptation, but rescue us from evil. this tells us how to do it. give</p>
<p>us our daily bread; live in the moment. if we forgive others we forgive ourselves, and we have released judgment.</p>
<p>now that we are living in the moment and clear of iudgment, we don t want to be tempted to</p>
<p>fall back into the old ways. this version of the lord s prayer is totally consistent with the three verses</p>
<p>that tell us to say yes to what we want and no to what we don t want, and not</p>
<p>to resist evil. the difference between the "official" version and this version is that the first places the responsibility for</p>
<p>the fulfillment of the lord s prayer on some entity "out there" and the second places the responsibility on the</p>
<p>self. forgiveness and grace are given on a one-to-one basis. no one can claim that "i am forgiven because i</p>
<p>am a christian." forgiveness and grace are a product of how we live our lives. jesus always comes back to</p>
<p>personal responsibility in one form or another. if we accept that father (parent) is the entity within, then it becomes</p>
<p>that if we are to forgive ourselves we need to forgive others. to what is within when it suits us</p>
<p>and what is legal when that suits us. we need to be single-minded about saying no to the unacceptable, and</p>
<p>yes to what is acceptable if we are to realise the person within. a single eye. no exceptions. then the</p>
<p>whole body will shine with light. what is within becomes visible. but if we work with what is legal, and</p>
<p>use being right to legalise our unacceptable actions, the whole body is in darkness. the person who is within cannot</p>
<p>be seen. reinforcement: the first thing to ensure is that we work on the person within being visible. if we</p>
<p>work on what is acceptable rather than what is legal, all the things we need will be added. this section</p>
<p>is not an invitation to be irresponsible. it is not an invitation to do whatever you like and expect everything</p>
<p>to turn out the way you want it to. it is an invitation to take care of the things that</p>
<p>are important. the essential part of this section is in the last two verses. first of all seek what is</p>
<p>within. we have been told how. just use those two little words "yes" and "no." harder than it sounds. how</p>
<p>do we say "no" when doing so might jeopardise the things we want? but we cannot serve two masters. we</p>
<p>do it or we don t. if we do hold fast to the truth that comes from within, all things</p>
<p>will be added, even if we do not know how at the time. don t worry about tomorrow, we have</p>
<p>sufficient to worry about in the evil that exists today. this can be difficult because it is often fear of</p>
<p>what might happen tomorrow if we say the sermon on the mount is not a religious document. it is a</p>
<p>practical guide to how to live if we want to create heaven in our hearts. it is an accurate and</p>
<p>detailed guide that loses its meaning if turned into religion. jesus, as a secular person in the context of his</p>
<p>practical teachings, is a far more powerful figure than religious judgment makes him. the punishment that we have received for</p>
<p>judging jesus in a religious context is that the real truth and power of his teachings have been lost to</p>
<p>us. when we iudge we are punished by our own loss. the way to find that answer as given by</p>
<p>jesus is to suspend judgment of yourself and others and ask. the answer will be given from within. then you</p>
<p>can say yes to what you want and no to what you don t want. then you will live the</p>
<p>life you want to live rather than a life according to the judgments of others. to live life without judgment</p>
<p>and according to who we are from within is a very narrow path. the path that jesus describes in the</p>
<p>sermon on the mount is a narrow path. but what is the wide path that leads to destruction? if we</p>
<p>do not follow that narrow path that comes from within we are destroyed. who we are comes from within. if</p>
<p>we try to live according to the judgments of who we are supposed to be, the person we are cannot</p>
<p>become manifest in the physical, and we are destroyed. the body may walk the earth for another fifty years, but</p>
<p>there will be nobody home. the person we are has been destroyed. the pressures to follow the rules and judgments</p>
<p>that surround us are enormous. it is easy just to give in and lose ourselves. but the narrow path leads</p>
<p>to life. life for the person we are, if we have the strength to follow that path. the false</p>
