<p>a disguise (a battered lab coat lying nearby), rubbed his hands in glee and pushed the door open, ready for</p>
<p>whatever lay outside. the first thing he noticed were the sirens: those endless, blazing, deafening sirens. his hands instinctively flew</p>
<p>to his ears and his eyes inexplicably screwed themselves up to protect themselves from the uproar outside. his will triumphed,</p>
<p>though, and he forced his eyelids open so that he could get a view of his surroundings and decide where</p>
<p>to go next. he had walked out into a busy corridor. men in white coats ran up and down in</p>
<p>urgency and panic. luckily, though, they were too engrossed in their emergency to notice the man who had walked out</p>
<p>of the cupboard; moreover, they were all covering their ears too, so thomas did not look out of place. he</p>
<p>decided to join the crowd and rush off in whatever direction they were all going. they were going left, and</p>
<p>so he started to run left, too. his running companions were shouting and spluttering to each ohure, yet thomas could</p>
<p>not catch a whole sentence: mere solitary words such as "rush", "cortical" and "breach" reached his ears from the mouths</p>
<p>of his new colleagues. be supposed it was important to work out what was happening to panic all these scientists,</p>
<p>but he would ask later. for the moment, the panic was a perfect cover for his movements. there was an</p>
<p>open door to the right. he rushed in as if he were an official and slammed the door shut. nobody</p>
<p>questioned him, and nor did he expect them to, for he knew that if you act confidently like you re</p>
<p>supposed to be somewhere, you normally don t get challenged. he found himself in what looked like an empty classroom.</p>
<p>a blackboard lay to his right with some incomprehensible half-finished equations scrawled on it. to his left were wooden desks</p>
<p>and chairs. the whole scene was reminiscent of a classroom from the 1950s (there was even a cane leaning against</p>
<p>the crook) and it clashed oddly with the rest of the interior he had seen so far. it certainly didn</p>
<p>t go well with the future-according-to-the-eighties theme which seemed to be going on in the corridor. right before him, between</p>
<p>the desks and the blackboard, was a large table. while there was nothing on top of it, thomas could spy</p>
<p>drawers underneath which may have contained something useful. he therefore went straight over to them and began snooping. normally he</p>
<p>would have been discreet, but given the general atmosphere of panic he figured that it wouldn t look out of</p>
<p>place for an employee of this establishment to be ruffling through papers in an urgent manner as if searching for</p>
<p>an important document. and with his old lab coat on, he was confident that a quick glance through the door</p>
<p>s window from someone outside would not raise any suspicions. in truth, though, he did not know what he was</p>
<p>looking for. the first two drawers contained mere stationery: rubbers, pencils and the like. it was only when he opened</p>
<p>the third drawer that he found any papers. most of them were to do with accounts. he found papers with</p>
<p>the words overhead and tax deductible and ohure such incomprehensible phrases written on them. they meant nothing to him, but</p>
<p>given that tgn had not told him what to look for, he scanned them anyway in case the man watching</p>
<p>the footage from his camera contact lenses took an interest and wanted to see more. he began to wonder what</p>
<p>precisely tgn did want from him, gregory and kathy. they had dropped them off in the centre of the enemy</p>
<p>s building without being caught... surely they could then have dropped off one of their own agents, with experience and</p>
<p>training? it made thomas wonder whether tgn was actually working with cybertech, or whether they even had any intention of</p>
<p>getting the three of them out alive... such thinking was not conducive to the situation, however. he had to think</p>
<p>positive. as he saw it, if tgn were double crossers, he was done for already- whatever he did. if they</p>
<p>were not, his best chance of escape lay in doing whatever they wanted and Waiting for them to rescue him.</p>
<p>then, hopefully, they would have the information they needed and let the three of them go free- with the answers</p>
<p>they had come to seek, of course. presently he opened the fourth drawer and found two documents of great interest</p>
<p>to him. the first item was a discarded blueprint for a machine. the head of the document was labelled "cortical</p>
<p>manipulation matrix mark iii". there was a date on the bottom right hand crook: 20th july, 2006, this was old,</p>
<p>then. nevertheless, despite the fact that the formulae and designs went right over thomas head, he reasoned that tgn might</p>
<p>be interested in this and took a good, long look at it for them. the second item was an old</p>
<p>copy of science today, its pages battered and torn as if someone had screwed it up in great frustration. he</p>
<p>recognised it immediately as the magazine vera pidgeonsworth had been reading on the day before his abduction by tgn. it</p>
<p>felt so long ago now, but the memory came back to him as clear as a summer s stream of</p>
<p>her wondrous expression and her insistence that she could see something in his eyes. his desire to have her explain</p>
<p>herself had been thwarted by the arrival of her headmaster. yet here was his opportunity to read what she had</p>
<p>been reading and perhaps discover the answer to his long-held curiosity. the front cover pointed his attention to an article</p>
<p>entitled "cortical confusion: are you who you think you are?", which could be found on page 12. he hurriedly flicked</p>
<p>through the pages until he found it and began reading voraciously. the article explained in simple language the theoretical discoveries</p>
<p>of a doctor earnest jones. it discussed the possibility of creating machines which could use his discoveries to transfer</p>
