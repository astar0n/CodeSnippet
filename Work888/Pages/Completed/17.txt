<p>s chocky, he told me. my spirits sank a little. i thought she d come away -- for good, i</p>
<p>said. matthew nodded. she did. but she s come back now. she says she wants me to tell you some</p>
<p>things. i sighed. it had been a relief to think that we had finished with all that, but matthew was</p>
<p>looking very earnest and somewhat troubled. i took a cigarette, lit it, and leaned back. all right, i said. i</p>
<p>m all attention. what things? but matthew had become abstracted. he did not appear to hear. he noticed my expression</p>
<p>though. sorry, daddy. just a minute, he said, and reverted to his look of abstraction. his changes of expression and</p>
<p>the small movements of his head gave one a sensation of seeing one side of a television conversation, with the</p>
<p>sound cut off. it ended with him nodding and saying aloud: okay. i ll try, though rather doubtfully. looking at</p>
<p>me again he explained: chocky says it ll take an awful long time if she has to tell me and</p>
<p>then i have to tell you because sometimes i can t think of the right words for what she means;</p>
<p>and sometimes they don t quite mean it when i can; if You see what i mean. i think i</p>
<p>do, i told him. lots of other people have difficulty over that at the best of times. and when it</p>
<p>s a kind of translation, too, it must be quite hard work. yes, it is, matthew agreed, decidedly. so chocky</p>
<p>thinks it would be better if she talks to you herself. oh, i said. well -- tell her to go</p>
<p>ahead. what do i do? no, not the way she talks to me, i don t understand why, but she</p>
<p>says that only words with some people. it doesn t with you, so she wants to try and see if</p>
<p>we can do it another way. what other way? i inquired. well, me talking, but sort of letting her do</p>
<p>it ... like my hands and the painting, he explained, not very adequately. oh, i said again, this time doubtfully,</p>
<p>i was feeling at sea, unclear what was implied, uncertain whether it ought to be encouraged, i don t know.</p>
<p>do you think ...? i don t know, he said. but chocky s pretty sure she can work it okay,</p>
<p>so i expect she can. she s usually right about things like that. i was uneasy, with a feeling that</p>
<p>i was being forced to take part in something suspiciously like a seance. i stalled. look here, i said. if</p>
<p>this is going to take some time, don t you think it would be better if you were in bed,</p>
<p>you d keep warmer there. all right, agreed matthew. so we went up to his room. he got back to</p>
<p>bed, and i sat down in a chair. i still had misgivings, a feeling that i ought not to be</p>
<p>allowing this to go on -- and a conviction that if mary were here she would disapprove strongly and i</p>
<p>only hoped that once matthew was back in bed again he would fall asleep. matthew leant his head back on</p>
<p>the pillow, and closed his eyes. i am going to think of nothing, he said. i hesitated. then: look here,</p>
<p>matthew. don t you ...? i began, and then broke off as his eyes reopened, they were not looking at</p>
<p>me now, nor, seemingly, at anything else. his lips parted, came together two or three times without a sound, parted</p>
<p>again, and his voice said: it is chocky talking. there was no air of seance about it, nothing of the</p>
<p>medium about matthew: no pale face, no change in his rate of breathing. except for the unfocussed look in his</p>
<p>eyes he was apparently quite himself. the voice went on: i want to explain some things to you. it is</p>
<p>not easy because i can use only matthew s understanding, and only his -- there was a slight pause --</p>
<p>vocabulary, which is simple, and not large, and has some meanings not clear in his mind. the voice was characteristically</p>
<p>matthew s, but the flatness of its delivery was certainly not. there was an impression of intended decisiveness blurred, and</p>
<p>frustrated; an athlete condemned to take part in a sack-race. unwillingly fascinated i said: very well, i ll do my</p>
<p>best to follow you. i want to talk to you because i shall not come back again after this. you</p>
<p>will be glad to hear this: the other part of his parent, i mean matthew, i mean your wife, will</p>
<p>be gladder because it is afraid of me and thinks i am bad for matthew, which is a pity because</p>
<p>i did not mean me, i mean you, i mean matthew, any harm. do you understand? i think so, i</p>
<p>said, cautiously. but wouldn t it be best to tell me first who you are, what you are, why you</p>
<p>are here at all? i am an explorer, i mean scout, i mean missionary -- no, i mean teacher. i</p>
<p>am here to teach things. oh, are you? what sort of things? there was a pause, then. matthew hasn t</p>
<p>words for them -- he doesn t understand them. not, perhaps, a very successful teacher? not yet. matthew is too</p>
<p>young. he can only think in too simple words for difficult ideas. if i think in maths, or physic, we</p>
<p>do not meet. even numbers are difficult. this is a good thing, i mean, lucky, i have quoted the above</p>
<p>exchanges as closely as i can remember in order to give some idea of what i was up against, and</p>
<p>to justify my corrections and simplifications from now on. a word-for-word record would be impossible. the usual words and usages</p>
<p>came easily enough, but less familiar words brought hold-ups. add to that the necessity to wade through a mess of</p>
<p>matthew s favourite, and not very specific, adjectives: sort-of, kind-of, and i-mean, and the conversation became so intricate that</p>
