<p>and a closed palanquin was brought in by four eunuchs. it was accompanied by veiled women singing something hawksworth did</p>
<p>not understand. the palanquin was carried to the center of the room, where a low platform covered with gold brocade</p>
<p>had been positioned, and then the eunuchs lowered it to the marble floor. the curtains were drawn aside and a</p>
<p>veiled woman emerged, her small body almost smothered in a dress that seemed made of multiple layers of beaten gold.</p>
<p>she was helped to the middle of the platform, still wearing a veil that covered her entire face. chants of</p>
<p>"hail to the bride" arose on all sides. then allaudin was escorted forward, taking his place on the platform beside</p>
<p>her. he stole a quick, distasteful glance at the veiled figure beside him, then an official smile illuminated his face</p>
<p>and he sat patiently as the qazi was summoned in front of them. the official was bearded, stern- faced, and</p>
<p>transparently arrogant. he Stood before the veiled bride and motioned around him for silence, "is it by your own consent</p>
<p>that this marriage take place with prince allaudin, son of his royal majesty?" from beneath the layers of the veil</p>
<p>came a muffled, almost hesitant, "it is by my consent." the qazi seemed satisfied and began reading a passage from</p>
<p>the quran, informing her that marriage depends on three circumstances: the assent of the bride and groom, the evidence of</p>
<p>two witnesses, and the marriage settlement. he then turned to allaudin and asked him to name the sum he brought.</p>
<p>allaudin mumbled a figure that hawksworth did not catch, but then the qazi repeated it for the guests. hawksworth caught</p>
<p>his breath when he realized the amount named was fifty lakhs of rupees. then allaudin said something else, which the</p>
<p>qazi did not repeat. later hawksworth learned that allaudin had added he was giving only ten lakhs of rupees then,</p>
<p>and the balance at some indefinite future time. the qazi blessed the royal pair, praying that they would be blissful</p>
<p>in this world and in eternity, and then wrote something quickly in a book he carried. finally the eunuchs appeared</p>
<p>again and assisted the bride into the palanquin. the marriage ceremony seemed to be over. a glass of wine was</p>
<p>placed in hawksworth S hand, and he looked up to see arangbar beaming with satisfaction. "now we drink, inglish. come,</p>
<p>sit closer and help me toast the bridegroom." "it was truly a royal wedding, your majesty." "but it s not</p>
<p>over, inglish." arangbar roared with laughter. "the hardest part is yet to come. does my son have the strength to</p>
<p>complete the work he s offered to undertake? no one can leave until we re sure." hawksworth had begun his</p>
<p>third glass of wine when princess layla reappeared, wearing a lighter dress, though still resplendent. behind her eunuchs carried several</p>
<p>palanquins piled high with vessels and trays of silver. following them were servants bearing bundles on their heads. "those are</p>
<p>the wares she brings to the marriage, inglish, and her servants, i think she will make him a good wife."</p>
<p>the royal pair moved together, layla still veiled, and then queen janahara stepped down from the dais and took a</p>
<p>large mirror handed her by a turbaned eunuch. she walked to the couple and stopped directly in front of them.</p>
<p>as they stood facing her, she held the mirror before allaudin and reached to lift layla s veil, giving him</p>
<p>his first glimpse of his bride. hawksworth studied her with curiosity. she was plain. and she looked very frightened. "it</p>
<p>s auspicious, inglish, if his first sight of his bride is in a mirror. i have not seen her before</p>
<p>either." arangbar examined her for a moment, then turned to nadir sharif. "what do you think? should i buy him</p>
<p>another one for his bed?" ";he s a goddess of beauty, majesty. inspiration for a poet." "is that what you</p>
<p>think?" arangbar sipped pensively from his cup. "well, perhaps it s true. we ll discover soon enough if she inspires</p>
<p>her groom." the guests watched as allaudin and layla were helped into a large palanquin. in moments their procession was</p>
<p>winding out of the palace, followed by layla s household silver, to a great fanfare of drums and trumpets and</p>
<p>the shouts of servants. "peace on the prophet!" "there is no nobility but the nobility of mohammed!" "allah be with</p>
<p>him, the noblest, the purest, the highest!" hawksworth settled back against his bolster and realized groggily that it was already</p>
<p>past two o clock in the morning, when the wedding procession had disappeared from view, the jubilant servants immediately turned</p>
<p>to preparations for the banquet. "sometimes life can be sweet, inglish." arangbar leaned back against a bolster and pinched janahara</p>
<p>s hand. "i think he should have more wives. you know there s a saying in india: a man should</p>
<p>have four wives: a persian to have someone to talk to; a khurasani to keep his house; a big-breasted hindu</p>
<p>from the south to nurse his children; and a bengali to whip, as a warning to the other three. so</p>
<p>far he has only the persian." hawksworth noticed that janahara did not join in the general laughter. then arangbar took</p>
<p>another drink and turned to hawksworth. "but you know i don t entirely agree with that wisdom, inglish. the holy</p>
<p>prophet, on whom be peace, wisely realized a man needs more than one wife. he also demanded of us that</p>
<p>we give each of them equal attention, never to turn away from any one of them. what man can do</p>
<p>that, even with allah s help? it is never possible. so we all do the best we can. it is</p>
<p>the will of allah." arangbar paused to swallow a ball of affion as he watched the trays of lamb being</p>
<p>placed before them. "tell me, inglish, have you found a wife for yourself yet?" "not as yet, your maiesty." he</p>
<p>paused. "there are so many to choose." "then take more than one, inglish." arangbar washed down the opium. "it</p>
