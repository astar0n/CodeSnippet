<p>heart of the empire, while his heart ached and his emotions raged, his mind recognized brilliance when he saw it.</p>
<p>despite all his efforts, genghis fell into the baron s trap after all. he felt like such a tool. jirko</p>
<p>must have flown fast, because it took almost a week before ohures confirmed his news. apparently all of china turned</p>
<p>against them, and the red baron led a few hundred thousand fliers. neighbors slaughtered mongols in their homes to take</p>
<p>their valuables and burn their businesses. northern china lost half of its population as those thieves migrated south for safety.</p>
<p>listening to multiple witnesses tell the same story, genghis khan, his face emotionless, finally gave the order: billy found a</p>
<p>surprising with his five battalions. his wife! princess hugged him before he even landed, sending them tumbling on the grassy</p>
<p>steppe. fortunately they landed in some bushes where they tore clothes off and enjoyed each ohure for the first time</p>
<p>in months. afterwards she showed him images of their beautiful baby son. "he s just like you," princess claimed, "except</p>
<p>with my dark hair, eyes, and skin." "yet he s just like me? what, he s small and boyish?" billy</p>
<p>asked jokingly. princess didn t fly here alone, he saw many from jack s personal guard approach them. "no, because</p>
<p>he s demanding, cries when he doesn t get what he wants, and tries to pee on me," prince joked.</p>
<p>"brohure," billy replied, "i don t care how far you ve flown or how much you look like my beautiful</p>
<p>wife, i am not having sex with you. anymore." prince must have had a good year since he didn t</p>
<p>get all prickly on him. "you re lucky fatherhood has mellowed me. i have twelve kids so far, and a</p>
<p>bunch more on the way. dear sister, here, has them milk me like a cow." "and me like an elephant,"</p>
<p>bear boasted. "those magnificent wands you gave me have somehow overcome my great looks, charismatic personality, and elephantine penis. i</p>
<p>don t have as many babies as prince charming here but, then again, i don t have an inferiority complex</p>
<p>from having a tiny penis. and don t get me started on tiny," he said, gesturing to the huge american</p>
<p>indian. "we re saving the biggest ladies for him because this world doesn t have enough giants." "only mine look</p>
<p>exactly like you," a radiant blade pointed out, showing images of their son. "after the imperial guard attack on you,</p>
<p>we sent the babies to relatives back home for safety." "you look different without all the pent-up anger," billy observed.</p>
<p>"better or worse?" blade demanded, an edge to her voice. "oh, better. much better. did you want to give our</p>
<p>son a little brohure or sister?" "i didn t fly several thousand kilometers to hear your jokes," she said with</p>
<p>a smile. billy turned to prince. "struck out again?" "nah, just too busy. and no one wants to confuse the</p>
<p>kids with multiple fathers. if i had kids with blade, what would their relationship be with your kids with princess?</p>
<p>siblings of half-siblings?" "yes, i turned him down," blade confirmed. princess had jack s old bodyguard travel the world recruiting</p>
<p>the best anti-mongolian quads. because so many suddenly had so much wealth, fielding an air force paradoxically became very hard.</p>
<p>super-quads -- those with blades eight meters or longer -- were already rich. they fought for reasons ohure than money,</p>
<p>so becoming richer did not make them want to stop fighting. but without quads to lead, and with american jack</p>
<p>too busy investing money, they sought out the one guy still fighting the good fight: the red baron. and princess</p>
<p>assumed they would both be safer surrounded by a few thousand of the world s best quads. pleasantries over, they</p>
<p>told him their fifty battalions took as many mongolian lives and valuables as possible until genghis arrived with half a</p>
<p>million troops. the fragmented europeans didn t dare field an air force against him, even if they somehow found enough</p>
<p>fliers, and reioiced when news broke that this huge air force would return east to destroy the red baron rather</p>
<p>than ravage europe. then they formed a unified european air force, fortified eastern europe, and strongly discouraged any more raids</p>
<p>into central asia, russia, arabia, or persia. so they looked for the baron and instead found five thousand americans about</p>
<p>to run into five hundred thousand mongols. "i m surprisingd you re not still protecting jack," billy commented. "he replaced</p>
<p>us with accountants," bear replied. billy laughed. "seriously! jack has to find the best ways to invest the thousands of</p>
<p>tons that suddenly fell into his lap. when your fleet arrived in england, he tried to put that wealth into</p>
<p>his general war fund, rather than your general war fund." "yeah," billy said. "i bought the english company that made</p>
<p>the revolutionary steamship that clipper ship lovers hate so much. last year i ordered them to build a warship version</p>
<p>that s more seaworthy and capable of longer journeys. england is the leader of the industrial revolution, so i want</p>
<p>to flesh out the design there. once they finish a warship, they will thoroughly evaluated it, then incorporate improvements in</p>
<p>the next ship. the empire will have to garrison every coastline because they will never know when my battleships could</p>
<p>appear over the horizon." that was exciting news that showed billy always thinking ahead. "hey, how many quads did you</p>
<p>bring?" "just over three thousand," grandma answered, apparently in charge. "plus their spouses and a thousand ladies who wish to</p>
<p>mate with the world s most powerful quads." "if you re not getting any, grandma, maybe you can convince princess</p>
<p>to fit you into my schedule," billy joked. "two hundred years ago that may have sounded tempting," grandma answered. "but</p>
<p>then i out-grew little boys. no, a woman with my passion would break you like a twig. tiny, however," she</p>
<p>said looking up at him, "doesn t look too fragile." tiny, to his credit, didn t bat an eye.</p>
