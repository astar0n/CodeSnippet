<p>we passed the plateau and were again venturing upwards until by dusk we neared the foot of mount eleos itself.</p>
<p>there we camped for the night. the weather by now had become considerably cooler than anything we had ever experienced</p>
<p>in paradise. however, we were well prepared. amongst our supplies, we had clothing made from special material found only in</p>
<p>paradise, material that was relatively light, yet exceptionally effective against the cold. that, plus the fact that our bodies were</p>
<p>now much more resistant against the cold, meant that we could easily cope with any adverse weather conditions we met.</p>
<p>also, our tents were comfortable and warm, being likewise constructed from material far superior to anything we had known in</p>
<p>the old world. that night we all sat around a campfire where george and my father were cooking some fish</p>
<p>fruits on a skewer. after dinner, we lingered around the fire, talking, laughing, and later even singing, until finally, one</p>
<p>by one, everybody went into the tents, and into their respective sleeping bags. finally, i was the last one left.</p>
<p>by then the campfire was dying, and thus i instinctively huddled next to the glowing embers. far off in the</p>
<p>distance, i heard a lone cry of a wolf. an eerie feeling swept over me as i realized that the</p>
<p>day of reckoning would soon be upon me, the day i was to meet up with the person who had</p>
<p>murdered me. i instinctively turned to prayer, and once more i was calm. a final look into the glowing embers</p>
<p>and off i went into one of the tents. there i snuggled into a sleeping bag next to my parents.</p>
<p>the wolf howled once more but i felt as comfortable and secure as if wrapped in cotton wool. i gave</p>
<p>a final yawn and fell soundly asleep. at dawn the next day, we continued our trek, now going upwards on</p>
<p>the slopes of eleos, the weather getting ever colder by the hour, although so far this caused us little concern.</p>
<p>by early afternoon, the first snowflakes fell, just as it had when i had made my feeble attempt up the</p>
<p>11,000 foot peak of mount hood, in the cascade range. then it had stopped me, and i had eagerly returned</p>
<p>to base. however, now i had all the agility and endurance of a mountain goat. as the day progressed into</p>
<p>the late afternoon, we had passed the tree line and the mountain suddenly appeared desolate and forsaken. snowflakes were now</p>
<p>coming down in thick, heavy clumps, covering the surrounding scenery completely in a blanket of white. every step we made</p>
<p>came with a great sloshing sound as we sunk shin deep into the snow. however, dad and george loved every</p>
<p>moment of it: the rugged wilderness, the jagged surrounding peaks, and the mesmerizing white all around. carlos, on the other</p>
<p>hand, looked far less enthusiastic, his normal bright countenance now replaced with one of stoical resignation. george s wife, flo,</p>
<p>likewise faced the task with similar determination. so did i until later that day, when all sense of adventure had</p>
<p>deserted me. although still managing well under the physical strain, as we all were, i nonetheless began to hate this</p>
<p>trek up the mountain. the only thing that comforted me was the thought of reaching our miraculous cave home that</p>
<p>george had seen in his vision. however, my poor mother found it even harder. she really was close to breaking</p>
<p>point, and i think the only thing that kept her going were her incessant prayers, and my father s constant</p>
<p>helping hand. still, as with all journeys, no matter how long or tedious, there comes the destination, and so we</p>
<p>reached ours just before sundown. we were now on relatively level ground, not too far from the summit. and the</p>
<p>view was truly awesome. on the one side was another mountain, almost as high and rugged as ours. the opposite</p>
<p>side, only a few yards away from where we stood, was a cliff with a sheer drop of at least</p>
<p>three hundred feet. as we stared over this grand, maiestic panorama, all my fears and complaints were now forgotten. my</p>
<p>spirit soared once more, and i was again filled with a sense of wonder over this incredible place, which i</p>
<p>definitely now knew was not the cascades my father and i had known. thus we lingered, soaking in the incredible</p>
<p>scenery until finally george directed us to our new home. from about a hundred feet away, he pointed straight towards</p>
<p>the upper face of the mountain, where there was an opening barely large enough for us to get through. "hey,</p>
<p>look!" george yelled. "that s exactly what i saw in my vision. that s our new home!" we all stared</p>
<p>at him, dumbfounded, little realizing just how incredible this cave will turn out to be. we entered the cave s</p>
<p>entrance and, for just a second or two, saw only a large, dark and empty cavern. then, before our very</p>
<p>eyes, the cave miraculously transformed itself into a fully furnished home, a home that was in every way identical to</p>
<p>our home in deer park. this totally unnerved my mother. "i...i ca...can t believe it!" she stammered. dad too was</p>
<p>shocked, as we all seemingly were. however, my father quickly regained his composure, and even his sense of humor. "and</p>
<p>i thought we built houses quickly in deer park!" "but it looks exactly like our living room!" my mother almost</p>
<p>shrieked. "but this is exactly what i saw in the vision," george exclaimed, "right down to its last detail!" dad</p>
<p>placed his arm around mum s shoulder. "see, hon, it s all okay," he soothed. he forced a chuckle. "and</p>
<p>it s even warm in here." "but is it real, or is this only a vision we re all having?"</p>
<p>i asked. then, to satisfy my curiosity, i walked over to my mother s landscape. it certainly looked identical to</p>
<p>the one at home. i lifted it off its hook and then showed it to my mother. she hesitated</p>
