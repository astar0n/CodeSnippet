<p>paid their entrance fee. "look at this, matt. there s a curse on this place," debs said to me. "what</p>
<p>a cool picture," young jake said. "it s a witch," his dad answered. "if you steal anything from the castle,</p>
<p>you re cursed." "there s a looter daddy, can you read it out to me." "sure thing, little buddy." he</p>
<p>began. i have paid the ultimate price. i know it is wrong to steal from you, and i am heartily</p>
<p>sorry. i did not believe in the curse, but i do now. i was visiting the castle with my beautiful</p>
<p>wife susie, and i took a little bone. i wanted to return it, but i couldn t. me and my</p>
<p>wife had the most terrible luck. we were nearly hit by a train, drowned in the sea, chased by a</p>
<p>long dead executioner and beaten up in a space of a few hours. i lost the bone that i took.</p>
<p>i had no way to return it to lift the curse. i could not live with the curse, so i</p>
<p>had to give the spanish witch something to appease her. i hope the sacrifice is worth it. "wow, cool dad,</p>
<p>wish we had castles like this back at home." fake ran over to the other side of the room and</p>
<p>looked down a trapdoor. "wow, there are bones down here. what does this notice say?" his dad walked over and</p>
<p>read the legend. "this is the oubliette. it holds the bones of the last two people ever to die in</p>
<p>chillingham castle." matt looked down. took a photograph. nonsense, he thought. half those bones look practically new to me. chillingham</p>
<p>castle exists and is located in the north of northumberland in the top left hand corner of england. it has</p>
<p>featured on scariest places on earth as mentioned in the story, and also on most haunted and ghost hunters international.</p>
<p>it is a fantastic day out. many parts of the story you have ready are true, with only a little</p>
<p>bit of artistic licence thrown in. john sage, the executioner, did indeed work and die here and his actions and</p>
<p>the manner of his death are also true. allegedly. if you do visit chillingham, you will hear the ghost stories,</p>
<p>such as the one featuring the blue boy, again, all supposed to be true. and most of all, you will</p>
<p>see the picture of the spanish witch on the antique wardrobe, and you will be able read the looters from</p>
<p>people who have taken items from the castle and later returned them. as far as i know, there should still</p>
<p>be only one set of bones in the oubliette. that is, unless somebody else has taken something recently and misplaced</p>
<p>it. finally, i will say that i m sure that the modern day owners of chillingham would never consider throwing</p>
<p>a person down into the oubliette and leaving them there, not unless it was something really expensive you ve taken.</p>
<p>rachel took one look around the jam-packed auditorium of the diablo convention center and felt the sudden urge to lose</p>
<p>her lunch. no way could she do what cameron expected her to do. the mere thought of it was totally</p>
<p>ridiculous. she glanced at the closest exit sign and opened her mouth to speak. "don t even think about it,"</p>
<p>cameron said from beside her. "why?" rachel s stomach spun and her cheeks heated as cameron tugged her through a</p>
<p>sea of spandex and sequins. "you tossed your back stage pass, remember?" cameron s infectious giggle was swallowed by the</p>
<p>sound of hysterical, screaming women. rachel squeezed her eyes closed and swallowed hard. how could i forget? still, she had</p>
<p>to try to change cameron s mind one more time. "can t i just buy you a pair of shoes?"</p>
<p>rachel glanced down at cameron s feet, wrapped in a pair of strappy black sandals that boosted her height at</p>
<p>least six inches. surely the louis vuitton pumps in bergmann s window could provide a tempting incentive. a sly grin</p>
<p>creased cameron s lips. "nah," she said as she wrinkled her nose and pulled rachel through the crowd. rachel exhaled</p>
<p>in frustration, cameron had managed to talk her into doing something completely out of her comfort zone. cameron had this</p>
<p>bright idea (one of her best, she claimed) to get backstage to meet world-renowned rock star, jaydon hawke, at his</p>
<p>concert. a completely cameron thing to do, but oh so not rachel s modus operandi. cameron tightened her hold on</p>
<p>rachel s elbow. "i won t miss this opportunity, not even for you." rachel frowned. although she understood cameron s</p>
<p>excitement, she wasn t being entirely rational. "you realize less than 25% of women who attempt this feat actually succeed,</p>
<p>don t you?" cameron looked at her like she grew two heads. "where on earth did you hear that?" "i</p>
<p>didn t. i researched it. it s true." cameron shook her head. "you really need to relax, rachel." rachel gave</p>
<p>a heavy sigh. "there s no guarantee we ll get back there, let alone see hawke." cameron stopped and folded</p>
<p>her arms. "first of all, let me remind you that it was you who forced me to orchestrate this mission."</p>
<p>rachel flinched as guilt poked her. "i know and i m sorry. i was sure you d go back there</p>
<p>without me." rachel tucked a piece of hair behind her ear. "if you ll just wait two seconds, i can</p>
<p>run to the hospitality counter and explain. i m sure i can finagle another pass." the mischievous look that overtook</p>
<p>cameron s face made rachel s nerves tremble. "too late." cameron dismissed her with a wave of her hand and</p>
<p>nudged her toward the stage. "besides, you know as well as i do, i don t care if we see</p>
<p>hawke or not." rachel paused. she knew good and well cameron nursed a huge crush on hawke s drummer, sean</p>
<p>pirelli. and apparently, being the object of cameron s raging hormones was a dangerous thing. "yes, but what if</p>
