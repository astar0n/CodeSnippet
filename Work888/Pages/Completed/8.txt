<p>that end, the National Bank should intervene in the markets to support the denar, if necessary by using its foreign exchange reserves.</p>
<p>A stable exchange rate guarantees low endogenous inflation and economic growth. The claim that the denar is overvalued and hampers export growth</p>
<p>is false. Macedonian firms are not exporting more not because of the exchange rate, but because of outdated technology, wrong or deficient</p>
<p>marketing, lack of compliance with standards, antiquated design, and a general lack of competitiveness. ANTITHESIS: Macedonia would do better to introduce a</p>
<p>flexible exchange rate policy coupled with inflation targeting. Introducing an inflation target would create as much macroeconomic stability as any currency peg.</p>
<p>The government has at its disposal policy instruments that allow it to control inflation: introducing price controls and freezing the prices of</p>
<p>essential products, or even wages, healthcare costs and pensions; releasing commodities, oil, and minerals from strategic reserves; hedging (fixing the future prices</p>
<p>of foodstuffs, oil, and commodities by purchasing forward contracts in the global markets). The National Bank should allow for a gradual devaluation</p>
<p>of the currency, within a band or range or as a crawling peg. This will prevent speculative attacks on the denar that</p>
<p>currently are depleting the foreign exchange reserves of the country. It will increase the competitiveness of Macedonia s exports and reduce its</p>
<p>trade deficit. A strong currency has anti-inflationary effects, so any devaluation must be minimal, slow, and subject to market forces. Still, Macedonia</p>
<p>can also devalue its currency without any major repercussions (as not many credits here are denominated in foreign currency and inflation is</p>
<p>subdued). THESIS NUMBER 7 THESIS: The global crisis discredited the doctrine of the free, laissez faire market. The role of governments is</p>
<p>growing and they are assuming additional functions and responsibilities. Strict regulation should be introduced and enforced in various areas: the financial industry;</p>
<p>healthcare; employment; international trade; the environment; and so on. The government should become more involved in every phase of the economic cycle:</p>
<p>from entrepreneurship to taxation; from banking to manufacturing; and from education to healthcare. It should even consider re-nationalizing some utilities. ANTITHESIS: This</p>
<p>is a temporary crisis that has to do with excesses and imbalances of the system and not with the core beliefs and</p>
<p>theories that underlie it. This is not a crisis of capitalism, but of certain capitalists. Governments should let the private sector sort</p>
<p>itself out and interfere only to provide public goods and where there are systemic market failures (such as in the banking sector).</p>
<p>Even so, governments involvement should be time-limited and with a clear exit strategy. Written on May 27, 2009 Israel, Obama, Iran, and</p>
<p>Journalism "During Netanyahu s visit, Israel shared intelligence with the CIA regarding the potential for a terrorist attack which will dwarf 9/11</p>
<p>if Iran is allowed to continue with its nuclear designs and share its outcomes with allies such as Hamas and the Hizbullah.</p>
<p>Iranian proliferation is a direct threat to US National security. Obama s staff is ignoring the intel (HUMINT) because they believe that</p>
<p>it is intended to manipulate the Administration into accepting Israel s planned bombing of two facilities in Iran. They are also ignoring</p>
<p>intel regarding a Hamas cell in Cairo that is bent on mischief. The Israelis are shunned. The CIA is exasperated." How reliable</p>
<p>is this information? Can journalists be trusted not to be manipulated; not to substitute opinion and wishful thinking for facts; not to</p>
<p>be corrupted with the trappings of power or outright pecuniary incentives? Consider my case: On January 20, 2009, I appeared as a</p>
<p>guest in the most popular political affairs program in Macedonia ("Glasot na Narodot", or The Voice of the People). I warned that</p>
<p>Israel is willing to wait 6 to 8 months for Obama s "diplomacy" with regards to Iran s nuclear capability to show</p>
<p>some progress. If Iran remains recalcitrant, Israel plans to bomb two facilities in Iran as it did in Iraq in 1981, I</p>
<p>said. Refueling won t be a problem, I assured the program s host: both Egypt and Saudi-Arabia offered to help. This and</p>
<p>other interviews provoked speculations in Balkan media and on the Internet: Vaknin probably had assumed that the NSA (which has a presence</p>
<p>in Skopje, having recently moved some of its facilities there from Athens) will be monitoring the program and will report to Washington,</p>
<p>suggested one of them. Vaknin sister is Sima Gil-Vaknin, the IDF s (Israel Defense Force s) Chief Censor (true) and Vaknin is</p>
<p>a senior Israeli intelligence operative (which I deny emphatically). Recently, the leading Balkan newsmagazine "Fokus" published a long article about the Eligibility</p>
<p>Problem (Obama s missing original birth certificate and other personal documents). In that article, Fokus speculated that Israel may have written off</p>
<p>Obama and has embarked on a worldwide campaign to discredit him and counter his dangerous diplomatic and military moves. Vaknin, contended the</p>
<p>magazine, spearheaded these activities in Central and Eastern Europe and the Balkans in conjunction with the Hasbara s clandestine unit, which is</p>
<p>under the direct control of the Prime Minister s office. I have since denied these rumors, too. I am a journalist of</p>
<p>long standing (since the mid-eighties), have lived and worked in Israel and maintain a network of top-level, unimpeachable sources. I am made</p>
<p>privy to a lot of information and disinformation (see my articles about Macedonia s accession to NATO and the name issue). Like</p>
<p>every journalist, I sometimes can t tell the difference and get duped. But this is one of the risks of the First</p>
<p>Amendment. As I see it, my job is not to block or filter content. My task is publish with appropriate disclaimers regarding</p>
<p>the sources of my information. I should serve as an eBay of data, ranking the past performance of "vendors" of intelligence and</p>
<p>letting the fully-informed reader make up his or her mind whom to believe and whom to discredit. Back to the opening scoop:</p>
<p>Is it true? Did it happen? Who knows! All I can say is that someone wanted this information leaked. It could be</p>
<p>a arrow shot across the Obama administration s bow. It could be part of a much larger picture. It could be a</p>
<p>signal aimed at Iran. It may be a brazen fabrication. History will tell. But one thing it is for sure: a story.</p>
<p>Someone(s) told me, a journalist, this story. They wanted it out. The importance of a story sometimes lies not with its content,</p>
<p>but with its very release. It is the role of the discerning reader to read between the lines, connect the dots, and</p>
<p>come up with his or her own narrative. Interview granted to Maja Mihailovska of "Spic, May 29, 2009 1. Yesterday you said</p>
<p>that Macedonian economy have to stop with obsessively keeping up to fixed exchanged rate and to turn on to flexible exchange rate.</p>
<p>How do you argument that suggestion when everyone here has awful remembering of devaluation of the denar in the past and dangerous</p>
<p>of inflation spiral? Many of experts here agree that would be disaster for Macedonian economy? A flexible exchange rate is not the</p>
<p>same as a devaluation. A devaluation is a one-time act. A flexible exchange rate is a long-term regime of managing the exchange</p>
<p>rate of the domestic currency against a basket of foreign currencies. In a flexible exchange rate, the local currency can go</p>
