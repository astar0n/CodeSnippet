<p>back, she addressed herself to a point slightly above matthew s head. i recognized the technique she had sometimes used</p>
<p>with piff. in a kindly but firm tone she said: chocky, you really must let matthew be quiet and rest.</p>
<p>he isn t at all well, chocky, and he needs to go to sleep. so please go away and leave</p>
<p>him alone now. perhaps, if he s better tomorrow, you can come back then. see? said matthew. you ve got</p>
<p>to clear out, chocky, so that i can get better. he seemed to listen. yes, he said decisively. it appeared</p>
<p>to work. in fact, it did work. he lay back again, and visibly relaxed. she s gone, he announced. that</p>
<p>s fine. now you can settle down, said mary. and he did. he wriggled into a comfortable position and lay</p>
<p>quiet. presently his eyes closed. in a very few minutes he was fast asleep. mary and i looked at one</p>
<p>another. she tucked his bedclothes closer, and put the bell-push handy. we tiptoed to the door, turned off the room</p>
<p>light, and went downstairs. well, i said, what do you think of that? aren t they astonishing? said mary. dear,</p>
<p>oh dear, it does very much look as if this family is landed with another piff . i poured us</p>
<p>some sherry, handed mary hers, and raised mime. here s to hoping it turns out to be less of a</p>
<p>pest than the last one, i said. i set down the glass, and looked at it. you know, i told</p>
<p>her, i can t help feeling there s something wrong about this. as i said before, piffs aren t unusual</p>
<p>with little girls, but i don t remember hearing of an eleven-year-old boy inventing one... it seems out of order,</p>
<p>somehow... i must ask someone about it... mary nodded agreement. yes, she said, but what strikes me as even odder</p>
<p>is -- did you notice? -- he doesn t seem to be clear in his own mind whether his chocky</p>
<p>is a him or a her. children are usually very positive about that. they feel it s important... i wouldn</p>
<p>t say the feeling of importance is entirely restricted to children, i told her, but i see what you mean,</p>
<p>and you re perfectly right, of course. it is odd... the whole thing s odd... matthew s temperature was down</p>
<p>the next morning. he picked up quickly. in a few days he was fully recovered. so too, apparently, was his</p>
<p>invisible friend, undiscouraged by the temporary banishment. now that chocky s existence was out of the bag -- and largely,</p>
<p>i was inclined to think, because neither mary nor i had displayed incredulity -- matthew gained enough confidence to talk</p>
<p>a little more freely about him/her. to begin with, at any rate, he/she seemed a considerable improvement on the original</p>
<p>piff. there was none of that business of him/her invisibly occupying one s chair, or feeling sick in teashops to</p>
<p>which piff had been so prone. indeed, chocky quite markedly lacked physical attributes. he/she appeared to be scarcely more than</p>
<p>a presence, having perhaps something in common with wordsworth s cuckoo, but with the added limitation that his/her wandering voice</p>
<p>was audible to matthew alone. there were days when matthew seemed to forget him/her altogether. unlike piff, he/she was not</p>
<p>prone to appearing any -- and everywhere, nor did he/she show any of piff s talent for embarrassment such as</p>
<p>a determined insistence on being taken to the lavatory in the middle of the sermon. on the whole, if one</p>
<p>had to choose between the two, my preference was decidediy in favour of chocky. mary was less certain. are we,</p>
<p>she suddenly demanded one evening, staring into the loops of her knitting with a slight squint, are we i wonder,</p>
<p>doing the right thing in playing up to this nonsense? i know you shouldn t crush a child s imagination,</p>
<p>and all that, but what nobody tells you is how far is enough. there comes a stage when it begins</p>
<p>to get a bit like conspiracy. i mean, if everyone goes around pretending to believe in things that aren t</p>
<p>there, how on earth is a child going to learn to distinguish what really is, from what really isn t.</p>
<p>careful, darling, i told her. you re steering close to dangerous waters. it chiefly depends on who, and how many,</p>
<p>believe what isn t really is. she nodded. then she went on: it d be a most unfortunate thing if</p>
<p>we found out on that we re helping to stabilize a fantasy-system that we ought to be trying to dispel.</p>
<p>hadn t we better consult a psychiatrist about it? he could at least tell us whether it s one of</p>
<p>the expectable things, or not. i m rather against making too much fuss about it, i told her. more inclined</p>
<p>to leave it for a bit. after all we managed to lose piff in the end, and no harm done.</p>
<p>i didn t mean send him to a psychiatrist. i thought just an enquiry on general lines to find out</p>
<p>whether it is unusual, or simply nothing to bother about. i d feel easier if we knew. i ll ask</p>
<p>around if you like, i said, i don t think it is serious. it seems to me a bit like</p>
<p>fiction -- we read our kind of fiction, children often make up their own, and live it. the thing that</p>
<p>does trouble me a bit about it is that this chocky seems to have entered the wrong age-group. i think</p>
<p>we ll find it will fade away after a bit. if it doesn t we can consult someone about it.</p>
<p>i wasn t, i admit, being quite honest when i said that. some of matthew s questions were puzzling me</p>
<p>considerably -- not only by their un-matthew-like character but because, now that chocky s existence was acknowledged, matthew did not</p>
<p>always present the questions as his own. quite frequently he would preface them with: chocky says he doesn t</p>
