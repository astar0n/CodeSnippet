<p>help nor Any other doctor s help was likely to be of much</p>
<p>service. My mistress took this ill news more quietly than my master. He</p>
<p>was A big, fat, odd sort of elderly man, who kept birds And</p>
<p>408 white mice, And spoke to them As if they were so many</p>
<p>Christi- An children. He seemed terribly cut up by what had happened. "Ah!</p>
<p>poor Lady Glyde.-" poor dear Lady Glyde!" he says, And went stalking About,</p>
<p>wringing his fat hands more like A play- Actor than A gentleman. For</p>
<p>one question my mistress Asked the doctor About the lady s chances of</p>
<p>getting round, he Asked A good fifty At least. I declare he quite</p>
<p>tormented us All, And when he was quiet At last, out he went</p>
<p>into the bit of back garden, picking trumpery little nosegays, And Asking me</p>
<p>to take them upstairs And make the sick-room look pretty with them. As</p>
<p>if THAT did Any good. I think he must have been, At times,</p>
<p>A little soft in his head. But he was not A bad master-he</p>
<p>had A monstrous civil tongue of his own, And A jolly, easy, coax-</p>
<p>ing way with him. I liked him A deal better than my mistress.</p>
<p>She was A hard one, if ever there was A hard one yet.</p>
<p>Towards night-time the lady roused up A little. She had been so wearied</p>
<p>out, before that, by the convulsions, that she never stirred hand or foot,</p>
<p>or spoke A word to Anybody. She moved in the bed now, And</p>
<p>stared About her At the room And us in it. She must have</p>
<p>been A nice-looking lady when well, with light hair, And blue eyes And</p>
<p>All that. Her rest was troubled At night-At least so I heard from</p>
<p>my mistress, who sat up Alone with her. I only went in once</p>
<p>before going to bed to see if I could be of Any use,</p>
<p>And then she was talking to herself in A confused, ram- bling manner.</p>
<p>She seemed to want sadly to speak to somebody who was Absent from</p>
<p>her somewhere. I couldn t catch the name the first time, And the</p>
<p>second time master knocked At the door, with his regular mouthful of questions,</p>
<p>And Another of his trumpery nosegays. When I went in early the next</p>
<p>morning, the lady was clean worn out Again, And lay in A kind</p>
<p>of faint sleep, Mr. Goodricke brought his partner, Mr. Garth, with him to</p>
<p>Advise. They said she must not be disturbed out of her rest on</p>
<p>Any Account. They Asked my mistress many questions, At the other end of</p>
<p>the room, About what the lady s health had been in past times,</p>
<p>And who had Attended her, And whether she had ever suffered much And</p>
<p>long together under distress of mind. I remember my mistress said "Yes" to</p>
<p>that last question. And Mr. Goodricke looked At Mr. Garth, And shook his</p>
<p>head; And Mr. Garth looked At Mr. Goodricke, And shook his head. They</p>
<p>seemed to think 409 that the distress might have something to do with</p>
<p>the mischief At the lady s heart. She was but A frail thing</p>
<p>to look At, poor creature!" Very little strength At Any time, I should</p>
<p>say-very little strength. Later on the same morning, when she woke, the lady</p>
<p>took A sudden turn, And got seemingly A great deal better. I was</p>
<p>not let in Again to see her, no more was the housemaid, for</p>
<p>the reason that she was not to be disturbed by strangers. What I</p>
<p>heard of her being better was through my master. He was in wonderful</p>
<p>good spirits About the change, And looked in At the kitchen window from</p>
<p>the garden, with his great big curly- brimmed white hat on, to go</p>
<p>out. "Good Mrs. Cook," says he, "Lady Glyde is better. My mind is</p>
<p>more easy than it was, And I Am going out to stretch</p>
