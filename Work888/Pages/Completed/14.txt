<p>s a liar born, and he ll die a liar.</p>
<p>Look at his face; ain t it written there? Let</p>
<p>him turn those eyes of his on me. I defy</p>
<p>him to do it. The other, with an effort at</p>
<p>a scornful smile - which could not, however, collect the</p>
<p>nervous working of his mouth into any set expression -</p>
<p>looked at the soldiers, and looked about at the marshes</p>
<p>and at the sky, but certainly did not look at</p>
<p>the speaker. Do you see him? pursued my convict. Do</p>
<p>you see what a villain he is? Do you see</p>
<p>those grovelling and wandering eyes? That s how he looked</p>
<p>when we were tried together. He never looked at me.</p>
<p>The other, always working and working his dry lips and</p>
<p>turning his eyes restlessly about him far and near, did</p>
<p>63 of 865 Great Expectations at last turn them for</p>
<p>a moment on the speaker, with the words, You are</p>
<p>not much to look at, and with a half- taunting</p>
<p>glance at the bound hands. At that point, my convict</p>
<p>became so frantically exasperated, that he would have rushed upon</p>
<p>him but for the interposition of the soldiers. Didn t</p>
<p>I tell you, said the other convict then, that he</p>
<p>would murder me, if he could? And any one could</p>
<p>see that he shook with fear, and that there broke</p>
<p>out upon his lips, curious white flakes, like thin snow.</p>
<p>Enough of this parley, said the sergeant. Light those torches.</p>
<p>As one of the soldiers, who carried a basket in</p>
<p>lieu of a gun, went down on his knee to</p>
<p>open it, my convict looked round him for the first</p>
<p>time, and saw me. I had alighted from Joe s</p>
<p>back on the brink of the ditch when we came</p>
<p>up, and had not moved since. I looked at him</p>
<p>eagerly when he looked at me, and slightly moved my</p>
<p>hands and shook my head. I had been waiting for</p>
<p>him to see me, that I might try to assure</p>
<p>him of my innocence. It was not at all expressed</p>
<p>to me that he even comprehended my intention, for he</p>
<p>gave me a look that I did not understand, and</p>
<p>it all passed in a moment. But if he had</p>
<p>looked at me for an hour or for a day,</p>
<p>I could not have 64 of 865 Great Expectations remembered</p>
<p>his face ever afterwards, as having been more attentive. The</p>
<p>soldier with the basket soon got a light, and lighted</p>
<p>three or four torches, and took one himself and distributed</p>
<p>the others. It had been almost dark before, but now</p>
<p>it seemed quite dark, and soon afterwards very dark. Before</p>
<p>we departed from that spot, four soldiers standing in a</p>
<p>ring, fired twice into the air. Presently we saw other</p>
<p>torches kindled at some distance behind us, and others on</p>
<p>the marshes on the opposite bank of the river. All</p>
<p>right, said the sergeant. March. we had not gone far</p>
<p>when three cannon were fired ahead of us with a</p>
<p>sound that seemed to burst something inside my ear. You</p>
<p>are expected on board, said the sergeant to my convict:</p>
<p>they know you are coming. Don t straggle, my man.</p>
<p>Close up here. The two were kept apart, and each</p>
<p>walked surrounded by a separate guard. I had hold</p>
