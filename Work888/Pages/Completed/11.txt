<p>Russian Atomic Energy Minister, acknowledged that his country lost control over Iran s nuclear program. Iran, like Iraq, is a celebrated member</p>
<p>of the "Axis of Evil". Thus, the atomic complex, though protected by at least 10 SAM batteries, may well be the target</p>
<p>of an attack, Vsraeli and Russian officials told the Bellona Foundation, a Norwegian environmental group. This will not be without precedent: in</p>
<p>a daring air operation, Israeli iets pulverized an Iraqi nuclear power plant in Osirak in 1981. Ironically, it is America s aggressive</p>
<p>stance towards Iraq that drives the likes of Iran and North Korea back into the arms - and nuclear technologies - of</p>
<p>the Russian Federation. Russia is positioning itself to become an indispensable channel of communication and intermediary between the USA and what the</p>
<p>State Department calls "rogue states". On March 17, Russia s State Property Minister, Farid Gazizulin, met Iran s Defense Minister, Ali Shamkhani,</p>
<p>during a session of the "Iran-Russia Economic Commission in Tehran. The host s message was unequivocal: "Cooperation between Iran and Russia is</p>
<p>to contribute to sustaining peace and prevent conflicts in the region." According to Asia Times, in an earlier visit to Tehran, Russia</p>
<p>s Foreign Minister, Igor Ivanov, pledged to continue to collaborate with Iran on nuclear energy projects. "Iran has no plans to produce</p>
<p>nuclear military projects, this is a fundamental truth." - he insisted, Nor is the teamwork limited to commercial goods and services. An</p>
<p>October 2001 bilateral framework agreement has since fostered more than $400 million in Russian annual military exports to Iran, including air defense</p>
<p>systems and fighter jets. Russia is also increasingly involved in the crisis in the Korean Peninsula, South Korean President Roh Moo-hyun s</p>
<p>security adviser, Ra Jong-il, have held talks earlier this week with their counterparts in Moscow and Beijing. Russia, like the United States,</p>
<p>opposes the military nuclear efforts of North Korea. Though vehemently denied by all parties, South Korea floated last week, in an interview</p>
<p>Ra granted to the Financial Times, the idea of supplying Pyongyang with Russian natural gas from Siberia or Sakhalin through a dedicated</p>
<p>pipeline, as a way to solve the wayward regime s energy problems. According to the Korean daily, The Chosun Ilbo, Russian Ambassador</p>
<p>to Seoul, Teymuraz Ramishvili, revealed that discussions have been held on posting Russian or South Korean troops in the North to protect</p>
<p>such a pipeline North Korea insists that its atomic reactors are intended merely to forestall severe power shortages, now that the 1994</p>
<p>Agreed Framework, to provide it with fuel and two proliferation-resistant reactors financed by the West, is effectively annulled. Even Beijing, hitherto an</p>
<p>unflinching supporter of the Dear Leader, halted oil supplies to the North last month. The scheme is not new. In February 2002,</p>
<p>Russian Deputy Energy Minister Valentin Shelepov declared in Moscow at a meeting of the Russian-South Korean Committee for Cooperation in the Sphere</p>
<p>of Energy and Natural Resources that Russia seeks South Korean investments in the coal industry and in oil and gas extraction in</p>
<p>Eastern Siberia and the Far Eastern regions. The Russian daily, Nezavisimaya Gazeta, notes that, together with China, South Korea is already involved</p>
<p>in LNG ventures in Vrkutsk and the Yurubcheno-Tokhomskaya oblast. According to Stratfor, the strategic forecasting consultancy, Russia offered in the past to</p>
<p>construct nuclear power stations on its side of the border and supply North Korea with electricity. Russia is close to North Korea,</p>
<p>In its previous incarnation as the Soviet Union, in 1965, it built North Korea s infamous Yongbyon facilities. Russia was also instrumental</p>
<p>in convincing the North to agree to reactivate a railway line connecting it to South Korea. Kim Fang-il, the North s enigmatic</p>
<p>leader, celebrated his 61st birthday, in February, in the Russian embassy in Pyongyang. The mooted pipeline may be nothing but a pipe</p>
<p>dream. Even optimists admit that it would require 4 years to construct - more likely 8 to 10 years. But Russia is</p>
<p>in no hurry. Russian gas to the pariah state could yet prove to be a key ingredient in any settlement. Russia intends</p>
<p>to drive a hard bargain. It is likely to try to swap gas supplies to the Koreans for the preservation of Iraqi</p>
<p>oil contracts signed by Saddam s regime with Russian energy behemoths. Regardless of geopolitical vicissitudes, Russia views Asia - mainly China, Japan</p>
<p>and South Korea - as growth markets for its energy products. By 2008 or 2010, Russia plans to sell 20-30 billion cubic</p>
<p>meters a year of gas from the Kovykta field, co-developed by Interros, the Tyumen oil company and British Petroleum, to China, South</p>
<p>Korea and, possibly, Mongolia. According to Asia Times: "Russia is looking at two competing plans. One, backed by Russia s top oil</p>
<p>firm Yukos and China, is a $2.5 billion, 2,400- kilometer extension of the existing network from near ?rkutsk to Daqing, China, The</p>
<p>other, backed by Rosneft and Japan, would cost $5.2 billion and circumvent China, running 3,800 kilometers to the Russian Far East city</p>
<p>of Nakhodka on the Sea of Japan ... The Russian Energy Ministry eventually recommended that the Japanese and Chinese proposals be combined</p>
<p>into one project, a third option to build the (1.6 million barrel a day) pipeline to Daqing and then extend it to</p>
<p>Nakhodka." Extending the network eastward is by no means the consensus. Prime Minister Mikhail Kasyanov opened a cabinet meeting last month with</p>
<p>the confident - but speculative - declaration that there is enough oil in Siberia to justify a pipeline. Russia s Energy Minister,</p>
<p>Igor Yusufov, observed correctly that, in the absence of sufficient exploration, oil and gas reserves in Siberia and the Far East, pegged</p>
<p>at 1 billion tons, are, at best, guesstimates. If these are smaller than projected, the eastern thrust would prove to be a</p>
<p>costly error. More than $12 billion are needed in order to explore the vast swathe and to develop it to a profitable</p>
<p>level of production - about 100 million tons a year by 2020. The pipelines will funnel 70-80 million tons of crude and</p>
<p>30 billion cubic meters of natural gas a year to Asian buyers. Still, Russia cannot ignore the Asian markets, nor can it</p>
<p>wait a decade or two to avoid commercial risks. Last week, Russia s Energy Ministry concluded the negotiation of a 10-year collaborative</p>
<p>effort with Japan involving the construction of oil and gas pipelines, the development of hydrocarbon fuel reserves in Siberia and other projects.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Russian Ambassador to China, Igor Rogachev, told "interfax, the Russian news agency, that "in the past three years, the dynamic growth</p>
<p>of merchandise turnover (between Russia and China led to a) volume (of) close to $12 billion last year. This year the volume</p>
<p>of bilateral trade grew 37 percent for the first two months and exceeded $2 billion." Russian exports to China since the beginning</p>
<p>of the year soared by 2I percent and Russian imports by 62 percent. China is an avid consumer of Russian electricity generation,</p>
<p>aviation, space, laser, and nuclear technologies. Russian firms made inroads into the construction of Chinese hydroelectric plants and railways, The two countries</p>
<p>have "plans for the construction of the Russia-China oil pipeline, and delivering up to 30 million tons of oil a year in</p>
<p>it, and a gas pipeline from eastern Siberia to the northeast of (North Korea), and to consumers in third countries." Russia</p>
