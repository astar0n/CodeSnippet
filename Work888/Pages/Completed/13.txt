<p>assignment tonight." "tonight!" juli said. "what about the ceremony and all that stuff?" marian asked. sara gave a small shrug.</p>
<p>if she weren t ?o ashamed of it, she might not have exaggerated the truth. "they usually have a big</p>
<p>ceremony. my teacher said i did very well...?o i guess that s why i graduated alone." "still, you could have</p>
<p>told us you were graduating," juli said. "hey, it was a private ceremony for ?ome rea?on. believe me, i didn</p>
<p>t like it, and i would have felt horrible telling you guys you couldn t go!" the worried look on</p>
<p>juli and marian s face was clear. "what s going to happen? where will they send you?" juli asked. "i</p>
<p>don t know, but the marshal will give me my assignment in a few hours. marian appeared as if she</p>
<p>were going to cry. "you re joking, aren t you?" sara shook her head. "don t get mushy. it s</p>
<p>not like we re never going to see each other again. hopefully i ll stay here in new haven, but</p>
<p>if not, i promise to try and stay in touch." marian and juli wrapped their arms around sara for a</p>
<p>group hug and began to cry, which made sara feel awkward. "you d better," marian said. sara did her best</p>
<p>to remain stoic. "c mon, you two," she said, but after several moments she found herself on the brink of</p>
<p>tears. "both of you are just weird." it was late in the evening. arthur waited impatiently just outside the citadel.</p>
<p>"where is that girl?" he said, leaning on the wall and folding his arms across his chest. the grounds were</p>
<p>now empty of commoners. only a few patrols walked about. a guardian in the citadel set a torch against a</p>
<p>small reservoir of oil that fed into all of the lamps in the ground outside. arthur stared off into the</p>
<p>surrounding city. the light from the buildings gave them a subtle silhouette. it was actually quite calming. just as he</p>
<p>was about go off into a daydream, sara came running into view. "it s about time!" arthur said. sara was</p>
<p>back in uniform, mostly. she struggled to place one of her armbands on as she made her way to the</p>
<p>citadel. "excuse me!" she said, almost plowing through several guardians who barely managed to get out of her way. arthur</p>
<p>opened the door as if he were expecting sara to keep going. she was going ?o fast he was surprised</p>
<p>that she managed to stop before reaching the door, "?orry," sara said, "my friends and i were at the pub.</p>
<p>they wanted to give me a good sendoff." "you better not be tipsy!" arthur said. "i drank one little glass."</p>
<p>arthur sniffed the air and thought he picked up a slight whiff of alcohol. he shook his head in disappointment.</p>
<p>"you haven t been a guardian even a day and you re already pushing it." "it was one glass," sara</p>
<p>said, placing her hands on her hips. arthur waved his hand for sara to go inside. "let s go. the</p>
<p>marshal is waiting in the great hall." sara could never really keep her eyes in front of her to see</p>
<p>where she was going. "you know, i think i ve only seen half of this building. i need to take</p>
<p>own on a tour one of these days." "you won t find anything more interesting in here than outside," arthur</p>
<p>said. "after one week on assignment, i bet you ll want to get as far away from this place as</p>
<p>possible." after a few minutes of walking, sara started to ask. "?o, about my first assignment..." "i ve already spoken</p>
<p>with the marshal," arthur said. "you ll get what you want, and i ve pulled a few strings to have</p>
<p>you assigned here in new haven." sara s face lit up. "really? i can t believe you did that. i</p>
<p>was worried i would be assigned to patrol one of the routes between the cities." "don t make me regret</p>
<p>this!" "don t worry, i promise i won t screw up." arthur opened another door and allowed sara through first.</p>
<p>"you shouldn t make promises like that," he said. sara passed by, but then stopped and turned to arthur. "then</p>
<p>how about i ll do my best? " "i can appreciate that," arthur said with a wink. "c mon, the</p>
<p>marshal is right through that door." it didn t show, but sara became anxious looking at the large door at</p>
<p>the end of the hall, and with every step she took toward it, her anxiousness turned to excitement. "remember, just</p>
<p>take the nearest seat next to him and please be nice." "no problem," sara said. being the noble guardian he</p>
<p>was, arthur opened the door and politely allowed sara to pass first. the great hall was a very large circular</p>
<p>room with a huge table in the middle surrounded by chairs. henry, a man who looked about as old as</p>
<p>arthur, was sitting patiently in a chair. a small candle and ?ome papers sat on the table in front of</p>
<p>him. henry was a marshal, a guardian assigned to lead the other guardians in a particular area, like a city.</p>
<p>sara sat down next to him. "hello, ranger," henry said. "hello," she responded. "?o what did you think of the</p>
<p>training? tough, isn t it?" "yes, it was, sir." henry began ruffling through the papers in front of him. "i</p>
<p>hear you graduated alone and early, too!" "um...yeah," sara said uneasily. henry leaned towards sara with a smile on his</p>
<p>face. "congratulations!" he said before returning to his papers. sara s eyes wandered around at the numerous painted windowpanes around</p>
<p>the room. "now," henry continued, seemingly more excited than sara. "i have five positions in the three cities. there are</p>
<p>openings here in new haven. one in alaria, and one in genoa. did you have one in mind?" "yes," sara</p>
<p>answered without hesitation. "i d like to be assigned here in new haven." "it shall be done," henry said.</p>
