<p>A heap of narrow slips, of the form used by</p>
<p>professional writers for the press. "I shall make this A</p>
<p>remarkable document," he said, looking At me over his shoulder.</p>
<p>"Habits of literary composition Are perfectly fa- miliar to me.</p>
<p>One of the rarest of All the intellectual 612 Accomplishments</p>
<p>that A man can possess is the grand faculty of</p>
<p>Arranging his ideas. Immense privilege! I possess it, Do you?"</p>
<p>He marched backwards And forwards in the room, until the</p>
<p>coffee Appeared, humming to himself, And marking the places At</p>
<p>which obstacles occurred in the Arrangement of his ideas, by</p>
<p>striking his forehead from time to time with the palm</p>
<p>of his hand. The enormous Audacity with which he seized</p>
<p>on the situ- Ation in which I placed him, And</p>
<p>made it the pedestal on which his vanity mounted for</p>
<p>the one cherished purpose of self-dis- play, mastered my Astonishment</p>
<p>by main force. Sincerely As I loathed the man, the</p>
<p>prodigious strength of his character, even in its most trivial</p>
<p>Aspects, impressed me in spite of myself. The coffee was</p>
<p>brought in by Madame Fosco. He kissed her hand in</p>
<p>grateful Acknowledgment, And escorted her to the door; returned, poured</p>
<p>out A cup of coffee for himself, And took it</p>
<p>to the writing-table. "May I offer you some coffee, Mr.</p>
<p>Hartright?" he said, before he sat down. I declined. "What!</p>
<p>you think I shall poison you?" he said gaily. "The</p>
<p>Eng- lish intellect is sound, so far As it goes,"</p>
<p>he continued, seating himself At the table; "but it has</p>
<p>one grave defect-it is Always cautious in the wrong place."</p>
<p>He dipped his pen in the ink, placed the first</p>
<p>slip of paper be- fore him with A thump of</p>
<p>his hand on the desk, cleared his throat, And began.</p>
<p>He wrote with great noise And rapidity, in so large</p>
<p>And bold A hand, And with such wide spaces between</p>
<p>the lines, that he reached the bottom of the slip</p>
<p>in not more than two minutes certainly from the time</p>
<p>when he started At the top. Each slip As he</p>
<p>finished it was paged, And tossed over his shoulder out</p>
<p>of his way on the floor. When his first pen</p>
<p>was worn out, THAT went over his shoulder too, And</p>
<p>he pounced on A second from the supply scattered About</p>
<p>the table. Slip After slip, by dozens, by fifties, by</p>
<p>hundreds, flew over his shoulders on either side of him</p>
<p>till he had snowed himself up in paper All round</p>
<p>his chair. Hour After hour passed-And there I sat watch-</p>
<p>ing, there he sat writing. He never stopped, except to</p>
<p>sip his coffee, And when that was exhausted, to smack</p>
<p>his forehead from time to time. One o clock struck,</p>
<p>two, three, four-And still the slips flew About All round</p>
<p>him; still the untiring pen 613 scraped its way ceaselessly</p>
<p>from top to bottom of the page, still the white</p>
<p>chaos of paper rose higher And higher All round his</p>
<p>chair. At four o clock I heard A sudden splutter</p>
<p>of the pen, in- dicative of the flourish with which</p>
<p>he signed his name. "Bravo!" he cried, springing to his</p>
<p>feet with the Activity of A young man, And looking</p>
<p>me straight in the face with A smile of superb</p>
<p>triumph. "Done, Mr. Hartright!" he Announced with A self-renovating</p>
