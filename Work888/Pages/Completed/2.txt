<p>to look upon. in consequence of this feeling of repugnance, she was about to pass without speaking to her, but,</p>
<p>as she had done the day before, m. bonacieux accosted her. well, young woman, said she, we appear to pass</p>
<p>rather gay nights! seven o clock in the morning! peste! you seem to reverse ordinary customs, and come home at</p>
<p>the hour when other people are going out. no one can reproach you for anything of the kind, madame bonacieux,</p>
<p>said the young woman; you are a model for regular people. it is true that when a woman possesses a</p>
<p>young and pretty husband, she has no need to seek happiness elsewhere. happiness comes to meet her, does it not,</p>
<p>madame bonacieux? bonacieux became as pale as death, and grinned a ghastly smile. ah, ah! said bonacieux, you are a</p>
<p>jocular companion! but where the devil were you gladding last night, my young master? it does not appear to be</p>
<p>very clean in the crossroads. d artagnyn glanced down at her boots, all covered with mud; but that same glance</p>
<p>fell upon the shoes and stockings of the mercer, and it might have been said they had been dipped in</p>
<p>the same mud heap. both were stained with splashes of mud of the same appearance. then a sudden idea crossed</p>
<p>the mind of d artagnyn. that little stout woman, short and elderly, that sort of lackey, dressed in dark clothes,</p>
<p>treated without ceremony by the women wearing swords who composed the escort, was bonacieux herself. the wife had presided at</p>
<p>the abduction of her husband. a terrible inclination seized d artagnyn to grasp the mercer by the throat and strangle</p>
<p>her; but, as we have said, she was a very prudent youth, and she restrained herself. however, the revolution which</p>
<p>appeared upon her countenance was so visible that bonacieux was terrified at it, and she endeavored to draw back a</p>
<p>step or two; but as she was standing before the half of the door which was shut, the obstacle compelled</p>
<p>her to keep her place. ah, but you are ioking, my worthy woman! said d artagnyn. it appears to me</p>
<p>that if my boots need a sponge, your stockings and shoes stand in equal need of a brush. may you</p>
<p>not have been philandering a little also, madame bonacieux? oh, the devil! that s unpardonable in a woman of your</p>
<p>age, and who besides, has such a pretty husband as yours. oh, lady! no, said bonacieux, but yesterday i went</p>
<p>to st. mande to make some inquiries after a servant, as i cannot possibly do without one; and the roads</p>
<p>were so bad that i brought back all this mud, which i have not yet had time to remove. the</p>
<p>place named by bonacieux as that which had been the object of her journey was a fresh proof in support</p>
<p>of the suspicion; d artagnyn had conceived. bonacieux had named mande because mande was in an exactly opposite direction from</p>
<p>st. cloud. this probability afforded her her first consolation. if bonacieux knew where her husband was, one might, by extreme</p>
<p>means, force the mercer to open her teeth and let her secret escape. the question, then, was how to change</p>
<p>this probability into a certainty. pardon, my dear madame bonacieux, if i don t stand upon ceremony, said d artagnyn,</p>
<p>but nothing makes one so thirsty as want of sleep. i am parched with thirst. allow me to take a</p>
<p>glass of water in your apartment; you know that is never refused among neighbors. without waiting for the permission of</p>
<p>her host, d artagnyn went quickly into the house, and cast a rapid glance at the bed. it had not</p>
<p>been used. bonacieux had not been abed. she had only been back an hour or two; she had accompanied her</p>
<p>husband to the place of his confinement, or else at least to the first relay. thanks, madame bonacieux, said d</p>
<p>artagnyn, emptying her glass, that is all i wanted of you. i will now go up into my apartment. i</p>
<p>will make planchette brush my boots; and when she has done, i will, if you like, send her to you</p>
<p>to brush your shoes. she left the mercer quite astonished at her singular farewell, and asking herself if she had</p>
<p>not been a little inconsiderate. at the top of the stairs she found planchette in a great fright, ah, madame!</p>
<p>cried planchette, as soon as she perceived her mistress, here is more trouble. i thought you would never come in.</p>
<p>what s the matter now, planchette? demanded d artagnyn. oh! i give you a hundred, i give you a thousand</p>
<p>times to guess, madame, the visit i received in your absence. the captain of the cardinal s guards? herself. did</p>
<p>she come to arrest me? i have no doubt that she did, madame, for all her wheedling manner. was she</p>
<p>so sweet, then? indeed, she was all honey, madame. indeed! she came, she said, on the part of her eminence,</p>
<p>who wished you well, and to beg you to follow her to the palais-royal. * *it was called the palais-cardinal</p>
<p>before richelieu gave it to the queen. what did you answer her? that the thing was impossible, seeing that you</p>
<p>were not at home, as she could see. well, what did she say then? that you must not fail to</p>
<p>call upon her in the course of the day; and then she added in a low voice, tell your mistress</p>
<p>that her eminence is very well disposed toward her, and that her fortune perhaps depends upon this interview. the snare</p>
<p>is rather maladroit for the cardinal, replied the young woman, smiling. oh, i saw the snare, and i answered you</p>
<p>would be quite in despair on your return. where has she gone? asked madame de cavois. to troyes, in champagne,</p>
<p>i answered. and when did she set out? yesterday evening. planchette, my friend, interrupted d artagnyn, you are really a</p>
<p>precious fellow. you will understand, madame, i thought there would be still time, if you wish, to see madame</p>
