<p>for it allowed a clear path to the sphere, if the cliff behemoth would take it. "dzeb?" ryson began with</p>
<p>respect, but not hiding his urgency. "i need you to get the sphere. i can t ask lief to do</p>
<p>it. it s making him sick. i have to hold the sword. can you reach it?" "i believe it is</p>
<p>why i am here," dzeb replied in his normal demeanor, as calm as if standing beside a deep blue mountain</p>
<p>lake. he moved forward with no outward expression of fear for his own safety. he completed the first part of</p>
<p>his task with such ease, ryson could only marvel at the spectacle. the cliff behemoth grabbed the ragged edges of</p>
<p>the metal sheets and tore them aside. the screeching whine of the yielding metal attested to the strength inherent in</p>
<p>the reflectors, but they could not withstand dzeb s power. as if opening a door upon a hinge, dzeb expanded</p>
<p>the opening, leaving him plenty of room to march through. he stepped up to the pedestal, his movements still relaxed,</p>
<p>his expression still without fear. without so much as a hint of reluctance, he reached out and plucked the sphere</p>
<p>from its support. ryson did not know exactly what to expect at that moment. he was relieved to see nothing.</p>
<p>the sphere accepted dzeb s hold without struggle. it left its home of countless ages without the slightest reaction. as</p>
<p>dzeb carried the sphere free from the broken casing, lief stepped as far back from him as the shadow trees</p>
<p>would allow. he nearly allowed his shoulders to brush against the closest of the branches. he could only wonder as</p>
<p>to which death would be more painful, being consumed by the shadow trees or the slow decay from the poison</p>
<p>which even now was sapping most of his strength. "we need to move quickly," the elf urged through a wheeze.</p>
<p>"i need to put more space between myself and the sphere. that will not be possible while we remain in</p>
<p>this tier." ryson acknowledged the request with actions. he retraced his path with greater speed and quickly guided them to</p>
<p>a point directly below the opening overhead. he looked to dzeb expectantly. "can you still make it with the sphere?"</p>
<p>dzeb seeing the pain in the elf s face did not take the time to answer. he placed the sphere</p>
<p>securely under one arm, bent his legs, and leapt upward with power unmatched by any other living creature. he sailed</p>
<p>through the air, through the open space between the trees. his momentum carried him nearly completely through the opening. his</p>
<p>ascent ceased as half his massive body was already through the aperture. with his free hand, he grasped the ledge</p>
<p>of the upper tier. with one mighty pull, he forced himself up the remainder of the way. as he disappeared</p>
<p>out of sight, lief sighed with relief. he took several deep breaths, but only appeared slightly stronger. "i believe the</p>
<p>poison has taken a great hold within me." he revealed with sadness filling his expression as opposed to disgust or</p>
<p>anger. "can you make the climb out of here?" ryson spoke with an edge, hoping to urge the elf onward.</p>
<p>"i believe so, though i don t know what good it will do." "it will give you a chance," ryson</p>
<p>pressed. "free air may help. who knows what will happen when the sphere is destroyed? and there are still the</p>
<p>algors. they might help revive you." the elf replied with great fatigue hanging upon his every word. "do not worry,</p>
<p>ryson. i will move forward, if only to see the end of the sphere which threatens my people." as if</p>
<p>to punctuate his statement, dzeb reared his colossal head into view of those below. "i have placed the sphere a</p>
<p>distance away from here. i will keep it away from lief as long as we are within this mountain, but</p>
<p>our exit is clear and it is time for us all to leave lief broke through to the open air</p>
<p>alone. be extracted himself from the fissure in sanctum s side to walk upon the inclined slope with labored, fatigued</p>
<p>steps. free of the cavern, with no stone overhead, he turned his head first to the night sky. the storm</p>
<p>had ceased and any trace of clouds had all but vanished. the stars hung proudly overhead, but they faded to</p>
<p>the east as the sky in that direction began to glow with an orange hue. the sun would rise soon,</p>
<p>another day would dawn. if the poison were not cleansed from his body, he knew it would be his last</p>
<p>day. he waited at the side of the breach, waited for ryson and dzeb. they had sent him through the</p>
<p>tunnel first, to keep him as far from the sphere as possible. they wished not to confine him in the</p>
<p>long cramped enclosure with ingar s sphere. not that it did much good. what would it save him? a few</p>
<p>extra moments of pain? the poison already coursed fully through his body. keeping him away from the sphere now was</p>
<p>like keeping the cat from the canary cage after the bird had already been eaten. he was, however, too weak</p>
<p>and too tired to argue. he found the mountain air mildly invigorating. he inhaled deeply. the fresh crisp night filled</p>
<p>his body with a refreshing chill. he was free of the stale air of sanctum, and free of the shadow</p>
<p>trees. if he could not cleanse himself of the poison, at least he could forget the terrors within the mountain.</p>
<p>though darkness still clung to the land, the twinkling stars and the eastern glow chased away his fear of the</p>
<p>dark. he sat heavily upon a large rock and crouched down to rub his ankle. it swelled slightly, pulsed with</p>
<p>slight pain, but thankfully, it was not a severe sprain. the fatigue within him, the poison adhering to his every</p>
<p>organ, this was the true threat to his health. he would collapse out of weakness long before this minor</p>
