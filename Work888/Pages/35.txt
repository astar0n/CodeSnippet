<p>about filling her own air mattress. five minutes later and breath slightly heaving, they pushed the mattresses out into an</p>
<p>open spot in the water and waded to their knees as the sun was blocked briefly by a thick cloud.</p>
<p>sylvia straddled the air mattress and sat down, pushing with her feet until they wouldn t touch, looking out to</p>
<p>the beach over the end of the yellow mattress that was popped out of the water. holly s orange mattress</p>
<p>drifted closer. at the beach she could see terry s hand gliding over iulia s back as her sister held</p>
<p>her long blonde hair up with one hand. he set the bottle down, stripped off his sunglasses, and suddenly scooped</p>
<p>iulia up with both arms, bridal style, and proceeded to the water with her. sylvia floated on the mattress, watching</p>
<p>her sister s halfhearted attempts at making terry put her down. a second later he paused, then dropped her into</p>
<p>the water, and dove under beside her. "you lost, red," holly said, al?o watching. "got everything wet." sylvia shrugged and</p>
<p>almost tipped herself over. "the lotion makes everything ?o dang slick," she mumbled. they watched terry resurface, stand and push</p>
<p>back his hair. holly said it first. "now he really looks like a vampire. see that peak at his hairline?</p>
<p>classic vampire." holly nodded. "would you stop with the vampire shit?" sylvia squinted at her sister s boyfriend. he did</p>
<p>look like one of those hand?ome, mesmerizing vampires that showed up on all the late night tv movies where the</p>
<p>woman fawned all over ?ome drop dead gorgeous bloodsucker. "bela lugosi never looked like that." "lugosi was just the first;</p>
<p>not the only one." the scene from the bedroom played through sylvia s mind, the one where terry had taken</p>
<p>iulia in his arms as if he were going to sink his teeth into her very neck. she shook her</p>
<p>head. "it s broad daylight. vampires don t go out in the sun. and there re no such things as</p>
<p>vampires, holly." "notice how he never looks directly into the sun?" sylvia looked to her friend, screwing her face into</p>
<p>a knot. "when was the last time you looked directly into the sun, holly sutton?" holly frowned, then shrugged. "you</p>
<p>know what i mean." "and he s got perfect teeth." holly sighed. "i ll bet everything about him is perfect."</p>
<p>sylvia shook her head, gently, ?o she didn t capsize herself, watching her sister enioying an afternoon of delight with</p>
<p>her new boyfriend. "not everything." she recalled when he d told her in the kitchen that he knew she knew.</p>
<p>"not everything." the following week of school was a drop for sylvia. her classmates and teachers began to settle into</p>
<p>a schedule of lockers, cafeteria food, and homework excuses. sylvia saw more of matt than she cared to, and not</p>
<p>because she wandered into the wrong locker room again. it was a traditional tasteless meal at lunch, the usual spaghetti</p>
<p>holly and sylvia were sure had been scraped off leftover high school plates, and the stale rolls that went with</p>
<p>it. holly had gone into chocolate mode as iamie became more attentive at lunch, offering to squeeze the ketchup over</p>
<p>her french fries and unwrap her straw. sylvia sat captivated by the warped middle school concept of going together until</p>
<p>she wanted to throwup. it was a little much, even with the fact that iamie was actually a sweet guy,</p>
<p>pick of the litter of eighth grade, and a basketball hero. well, as close as anyone was going to get</p>
<p>to being a basketball hero in eighth grade. more accurately, he just fumbled all the plays less than everyone else</p>
<p>on the team. "what about matt?" iamie said for the fourth time that week as they sat at the lunch</p>
<p>table. he looked to sylvia expectantly. "please, no." she finished the chocolate milk and sighed over her nachos. a table</p>
<p>away matt s radar must have gone off, and he waved, smiling, elbowing the nerdylooking boy beside him to witness.</p>
<p>"but he s nice," holly added. sylvia shook her head. "he smells like astringent." she made a face as she</p>
<p>looked to where he was running a hand through his reddish brown hair. he caught her gaze and stopped, letting</p>
<p>his arm fall quickly, and knocked over his milk onto his pants. she shook her head again, looking to holly.</p>
<p>"and it s not helping any." "you re gonna ban the boy because he s got complexion issues?" holly shook</p>
<p>her head, nibbling on a fry. sylvia looked to iamie. yup, iamie. no complexion problem there, she thought. not many</p>
<p>problems at all, in fact. against her better iudgment her attention turned to matt who was dabbing at his pants</p>
<p>with a napkin. okay, she thought fairly, a little thin, poor dresser, fashionless, too much hair, but he was nice.</p>
<p>a little ingratiating, she d learned from third hour science class, and a little nasally. "what about lane?" holly suggested.</p>
<p>sylvia lifted an eyebrow, picking a tortilla chip out of her cardboard basket and dipping it in what was passing</p>
<p>for cheese sauce. "lane who?" "brian s ex s kid. number one s kid." holly smiled at the thought, recalling</p>
<p>new year s eve s party. "he s okay." sylvia nodded. "yeah, he s okay." she put the tortilla chip</p>
<p>in her mouth, pretending it was delicious. "he s got a new tattoo." "oh, yeah? where?" "dunno. he got shipped</p>
<p>off to ?ome military boarding school. make a man out him or ?ome shit like that." "he looked like he</p>
<p>was turning out like one to me." holly smiled endearingly to iamie, who d given her a frown at the</p>
<p>statement. "yeah, i guess ?o," sylvia agreed, intent on her nachos. "what i don t get," holly said, dragging a</p>
<p>fry through her mound of ketchup, "is why number one s kids are younger than number two s kids. what</p>
<p>happened there?" "oh, yeah." sylvia shrugged. "number one is al?o brian s number three wife. they married, got divorced,</p>
