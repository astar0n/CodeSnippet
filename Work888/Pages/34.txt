<p>to a new position as he continued to fashion the diagram, which seemed to be the outline of some kind</p>
<p>of bush. "you see, except for olorun, the sky god, all our orisa once dwelt on earth, but instead of</p>
<p>dying they became the communal memory of our people. when we call forth one of the gods, we reach into</p>
<p>this shared consciousness where they wait. if a god comes forth, he may for a time take over the body</p>
<p>of one of us as his temporary habitation." he paused and looked up. "that s why i wanted you here</p>
<p>tonight. to show you what it means to be yoruba." he straightened and critically surveyed the drawing. his eyes revealed</p>
<p>his satisfaction. on the ground was a complex rendering of an african cotton tree, the representing-image of ogun. its trunk</p>
<p>was flanked on each side by the outline of an elephant tusk, another symbol of the yoruba god, he circled</p>
<p>it for a moment, appraising it, then went to the cache of sacred utensils he had hidden behind the mill</p>
<p>that afternoon and took up a stack of palm fronds. carefully he laid a row along each side of the</p>
<p>diagram. "that s finished now. next i ll make the symbol for shango. it s simpler." he knelt and quickly</p>
<p>began to lay down the outline of a double-headed axe, still using the white powder from the bag. the lines</p>
<p>were steady, flawless. she loved the lithe, deft intensity of his body as he drew his sacred signs-nothing like the</p>
<p>grudging branco artists who had decorated the cathedral in pernambuco with catholic saints, all the while half-drunk on portuguese wine.</p>
<p>"where did you learn all these figures?" he smiled. "i ve had much practice, but i was first taught by</p>
<p>my father, years ago in ife." the drawing was already done. he examined it a moment, approved it, and laid</p>
<p>aside the bag of white powder. she picked it up and took a pinch to her lips, it had the</p>
<p>tangy bitterness of cassava flour. "now i ll prepare a candle for shango." he rummaged through the pile. "but in</p>
<p>a way it s for you too, so i ll find a pure white one, not a bidding candle." "what</p>
<p>do you mean, for me too ?" he seemed not to hear as be lit the taper and placed it</p>
<p>beside the symbol. next he extracted a white kerchief from his waistband and turned to her, "i ve brought something</p>
<p>for you, a gift, here, let me tie it." he paused to caress her, his fingertips against her cinnamon skin,</p>
<p>then he lovingly pulled the kerchief around her head. he lifted up her long hair, still wet from the rain,</p>
<p>and carefully coiled it under the white cloth. finally he knotted it on top, african style. "tonight you may discover</p>
<p>you truly are a yoruba woman, so it is well that you look like one." abruptly, above the patter of</p>
<p>rain, tame the sound of footfalls in the mud outside. she glanced around and through the dark saw the silhouettes</p>
<p>of the yoruba men from the slave quarters. the first three carried long bundles swathed in heavy brown wraps to</p>
<p>protect them from the rain. they entered single file and nodded in silence to atiba before gathering around the diagrams</p>
<p>on the floor to bow in reverence. after a moment, the men carrying the bundles moved to a clear space</p>
<p>beside the mill and began to unwrap them. as the covering fell away, the fresh goatskin tops of three new</p>
<p>drums sparkled white in the candlelight. she watched the drummers settle into position, each nestling an instrument beneath his left</p>
<p>arm, a curved wooden mallet in his right hand. from somewhere in her past there rose up an identical scene,</p>
<p>years ago in brazil, when all the yoruba, men and women, had gathered to dance. then as now there were</p>
<p>three hourglass-shaped instruments, all held horizontally under the drummer s arm as they were played. the largest, the iya ilu,</p>
<p>was almost three feet long and was held up by a wide shoulder strap, just as this one was tonight,</p>
<p>the other two, the bata and the go-go, were progressively smaller, and neither was heavy enough to require a supporting</p>
<p>strap. the man holding the iya ilu tonight was obewole, his weathered coffee face rendered darker still by the contrast</p>
<p>of a short grey beard. his muscles were conditioned by decades of swinging a long iron sword; in the fields</p>
<p>he could wield a cane machete as powerfully as any young warrior. he shifted the shoulder strap one last time,</p>
<p>then held out the mallet in readiness and looked toward atiba for a signal to begin. when atiba gave a</p>
<p>nod, a powerful drum roll sounded above the roar of the gale. then obewole began to talk with the drum,</p>
<p>a deep-toned invocation to the ceremonial high gods of the yoruba pantheon, eleggua and olorun. "omi tutu a eleggua, omi</p>
<p>tutu a mi ileis, olorun modu- pue ..." as the drum spoke directly to the gods, the line of men</p>
<p>passed by atiba and he sprinkled each with liquor from a calabash, flinging droplets from his fingertips like shooting stars</p>
<p>in the candlelight. each man saluted him, their babalawo, by dropping their heads to the ground in front of him</p>
<p>while balanced on their fists, then swinging their bodies right and left, touching each side to the floor in the</p>
<p>traditional yoruba obeisance. the office of babalawo embodied all the struggles, the triumphs, the pride of their race, when the</p>
<p>last man had paid tribute, all three drums suddenly exploded with a powerful rhythm that poured out into the night</p>
<p>and the storm. obewole s mallet resounded against the skin of the large iya ilu, producing a deep, measured cadence-three</p>
<p>strokes, then rest, repeated again and again hypnotically-almost as though he were knocking on the portals of the unseen. next</p>
<p>to him the men holding the two smaller drums inter/"ected syncopated clicks between the iya ilu s throaty booms,</p>
<p></p>
