<p>the amount of smut. "early seeding has been practised by various farmers, and they report a marked reduction in smut.</p>
<p>"the replowing of the summer fallow after the first fall rains is generally effective in reducing the amount of smut.</p>
<p>"very late planting-that is, four or five weeks after the first good fall rains-is al."o an effective practice. fall tillage</p>
<p>of summer fallow, other than plowing, seems to be beneficial. "no smutimmune varieties of wheat are known, but the standard</p>
<p>varieties show varying degrees of resistance. spring wheats generally suffer less from smut than winter varieties. this is not due</p>
<p>to any superior resistance, but rather to the fact that they escape infection. if only spring wheats were grown our</p>
<p>smut problem would largely disappear; but a return to this practice is not suggested, since the winter wheats are much</p>
<p>more desirable. it seems probable that the conditions which prevail during the growing sea?on may have considerable influence on the</p>
<p>per cent of smut in any given variety," when dorn finished his discourse, to receive the thanks of his listeners,</p>
<p>they walked back through the yard toward the road. mr. ander?on, who led the way, halted rather abruptly. "hum! who</p>
<p>re those men talkin to my driver?" he queried. dorn then saw a couple of strangers standing near the motorcar,</p>
<p>engaged in apparently close conversation with the chauffeur. upon the moment they glanced up to see mr. ander."on approaching, and</p>
<p>they rather hurriedly departed. dorn had noted a good many strangers lately-men whose garb was not that of farmers, whose</p>
<p>faces seemed foreign, whose actions were suspicious. "i ll bet a hundred they re i.w.w. s," declared ander?on. "take my</p>
<p>hunch, dorn." the strangers passed on down the road without looking back. "wonder where they ll sleep tonight?" muttered dorn.</p>
<p>ander?on rather sharply asked his driver what the two men wanted. and the reply he got was that they were</p>
<p>inquiring about work. "did they speak english?" went on the rancher. "well enough to make themselves understood," replied the driver.</p>
<p>dorn did not get a good impression from the shifty eyes and air of taciturnity of mr. ander?on s man,</p>
<p>and it was evident that the blunt rancher restrained himself. he helped his daughter into the car, and then put</p>
<p>on his long coat. next he shook hands with dorn. "young man, i ve enioyed meetin you, an have sure</p>
<p>profited from same," he said. "which makes up for your dad! i ll run over here again to see you-around</p>
<p>harvesttime. an i ll be wishin for that rain." "thank you. if it does rain i ll be happy to</p>
<p>see you," replied dorn, with a smile. "well, if it doesn t rain i won t come. i ll put</p>
<p>it off another year, an cuss them other fellers into holdin off, too." "you re very kind. i don t</p>
<p>know how i d-we d ever repay you in that case." "don t mention it. say, how far did you</p>
<p>say it was to palmer? we ll have lunch there." "it s fifteen miles-that way," answered dorn. "if it wasn</p>
<p>t for-for father i d like you to stay-and break ?ome of my bread." dorn was looking at the girl</p>
<p>as he spoke. her steady gaze had been on him ever since she entered the car, and in the shade</p>
<p>of her hat and the veil she was adjusting her eyes seemed very dark and sweet and thoughtful. she brightly</p>
<p>nodded her thanks as she held the veil aside with both hands. "i wish you luck. goodby," she said, and</p>
<p>closed the veil. still, dorn could see her eyes through it, and now they were sweeter, more mysterious, more provocative</p>
<p>of haunting thoughts, it flashed over him with dread certainty that he had fallen in love with her. the shock</p>
<p>struck him mute. he had no reply for the rancher s hearty farewell. then the car lurched away and dust</p>
<p>rose in a cloud. with a strange knocking of his heart, high up toward his throat, kurt dorn stood stockstill,</p>
<p>watching the moving cloud of dust until it disappeared over the hill. no doubt entered his mind. the truth, the</p>
<p>fact, was a year old-a longfamiliar and dreamy state-but its meaning had not been revealed to him until just a</p>
<p>moment past. everything had changed when she looked out with that sweet, steady gaze through the parted veil and then</p>
<p>slowly closed it. she had changed. there was ?omething intangible about her that last moment, baffling, haunting. he leaned against</p>
<p>a crooked old gatepost that as a boy he had climbed, and the thought came to him that this spot</p>
<p>would all his life be vivid and poignant in his memory. the first sight of a blueeyed, sunnyhaired girl, a</p>
<p>year and more before, had struck deep into his unconscious heart; a second sight had made her an unforgettable reality."</p>
<p>and a third had been the realization of love. it was sad, regrettable, incomprehensible, and yet ."o-mehow his inner being</p>
<p>swelled and throbbed. her name was lenore ander?on. her father was one of the richest men in the state of</p>
<p>washington. she had one brother, iim, who would not wait for the army draft. kurt trembled and a hot rush</p>
<p>of tears dimmed his eyes. all at once his lot seemed unbearable. an immeasurable barrier had arisen between him and</p>
<p>his old father-a hideous thing of blood, of years, of ineradicable difference; the broad acres of wheatland ?o dear to</p>
<p>him were to be taken from him: love had overcome him with headlong rush, a love that could never be</p>
<p>returned; and cruelest of all, there was the war calling him to give up his home, his father, his future,</p>
<p>and to go out to kill and to be killed. it came to him while he leaned there, that, remembering</p>
<p>the light of lenore ander."on s eyes, he could not give up to bitterness and hatred, whatever his misfortunes and</p>
<p>his fate. she would never be anything to him, but he and her brother /"im and many other young</p>
