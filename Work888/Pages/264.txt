<p>this quit! simple question. when the people received no satisfactory answer from Panditii, the man said, "Pandit/"i, you have come</p>
<p>back after ten year long study at Banaras, but you failed to answer my simple question. You have wasted the</p>
<p>money of your father." The helpless Pandit stared blank in the face of the man, Panditji returned home with a</p>
<p>heavy heart. He could not sleep at night. He pondered deeply in his mind, "Today I have suffered great disgrace;</p>
<p>how should I show my face in the city now. It will be proper for me to go back to</p>
<p>Banaras and find Solution to this question." Lo! At dawn Pandit/Ii left home and set out for kiashi (BanaI"aS). while</p>
<p>he was on his way to Banaras on foot the evening fell. He took shelter on a platform in front</p>
<p>of a well-built house in a village. After supper he spread his bedding on the platform and lay down there.</p>
<p>Due to great fatigue he succumbed to sound sleep as soon as he lay down. He did not wake up</p>
<p>and lay there for a long time even after sunrise in the morning. The house, on the platform of which</p>
<p>Pandit/"i slept belonged to a prostitute, when the prostitute came downstairs in the morning, she saw the hale and hearty</p>
<p>handsome young man sleeping on the platform. She was bewitched and dumbfounded. She woke him up and asked, "who are</p>
<p>you? where do you hail from? what is your destination and what for are you going there?" Panditii replied, "I</p>
<p>come from Samtapur and am on my way to /<ashi." At this the prostitute spoke, "Sir, you told me everything</p>
<p>but I got no reply as to why you are going to i<ashi? Please tell me." Panditii said, "0 Gentle</p>
<p>lady! Don t ask this question to me. I am pained at heart by this." when the prostitute again insisted,</p>
<p>Panditii said, "Now listen, I stayed and studied at /cashi for ten years. After completing my education, I came back</p>
<p>home. As soon as I returned to the city, the people gave me a grand reception. Unfortunately that very day</p>
<p>during a question-answer program the people put to me a question, "what is the root cause of sin?" I failed</p>
<p>to answer this question. My heart was filled with remorse. This is why I am returning to /cashi for further</p>
<p>study." The prostitute was very wise. She said, "Pandit/"i, today I am lucky to entertain a learned guest like you</p>
<p>at my house. Please go ahead only after taking mid-day meals at my house today. I shall prepare food for</p>
<p>you with my own hands. Till then please take bath and say your morning prayers and perform worship." Hearing this</p>
<p>Panditii was in a fix. After a short pause Panditii asked the prostitute, "who are you and what is your</p>
<p>profession?" Prostitute - I am a human being. I earn my bread and butter through prostitution. Panditii - Curse it.</p>
<p>0 God! what a great sinner I am! I have slept in the house of an unholy prostitute. I will</p>
<p>have to repent for this sin. Prostitute - O dignified Brahman! I am also a human being like you. You</p>
<p>consider me mean and hateful only for being a prostitute. Once I was also a young damsel of a dignified</p>
<p>family, but the oppressions of your human society have forced me to resort to this sinful life. Today you are</p>
<p>my guest, I shall not let you go without taking meals. Panditii - O wretched lady." what do you say?</p>
<p>I am a holy Brahman - a Pandit. How can I take meals at your house? Prostitute - No, No,</p>
<p>Panditii! Meals you must take at my house. See there is a well in the compound of my house. Draw</p>
<p>the water and prepare food yourself and then take meals. You are a Brahman, so after meals I shall give</p>
<p>you a present of five hundred rupees as well. As soon as Panditii came to know about a present of</p>
<p>five hundred rupees, he was overpowered with greed. He at once got ready to prepare the food himself. when the</p>
<p>prostitute saw that the food was ready, she came down and prayed to Panditii with folded hands - "0 supreme</p>
<p>Panditii! I have committed great sins in my life. I pray to you to purify me as well." Panditii -</p>
<p>How is that possible? Prostitute - If you accept two morsels of food from my hands, I shall be purified.</p>
<p>Pandit/"i - curse it, why do you say this? How can I, a Brahman, eat two morsels from the hands</p>
<p>of a prostitute? Prostitute - Panditii, Please be merciful and do so. I shall offer you five hundred rupees more,</p>
<p>At least accept one morsel from my hands and make me chaste. Panditii agreed to take food from the hands</p>
<p>of the prostitute out of greed for money. As soon as she brought her hand forward with a morsel to</p>
<p>feed it to Panditii, the prostitute at once dropped the morsel on the ground and slapped the Brahman severely in</p>
<p>the face saying, "0 fool! You are going to kzashi to solve a quite simple problem. I have answered your</p>
<p>question. The greed with which you easily got ready to give up your religious faith and vows has overpowered you</p>
<p>and is the root cause of all sins." Someone has rightly observed: "Faith is like a bird, that sings when</p>
<p>the at dawn is still engulfed in darkness." On receiving a satisfactory solution for his problem from the prostitute, Pandit/Â°i</p>
<p>returned home. From the above example we learn that the more greedy a person is, the more disgrace he has</p>
<p>to suffer. To be over- greedy is a sin; greed is regarded as the root cause of sin. Hence, in</p>
<p>order to attain the virtue of supreme contentment every living soul should discard the vicious tendency of greed and tread</p>
<p>the path of religion. The great poet Reidhu has described the virtue of supreme contentment or purity (Uttama Shaucha) thus:</p>
<p>Sauch ii dhamangu tam ii amagaun bhinrganu uvaugmu Farmarnr vinrasanru tiiagpyasnru jhaiiyi ah visi ii dhu Dham sauchu hoi manr</p>
<p>sudhiyai, dham sauchu venr dhanr gidhien Dham sauchu kasaai ahavain, dham sauchu nr lippi pavain Dham sauchu lohu vaiantau dham</p>
<p>sauchu sutab pahi iantau Dham sauhuvanbh vay dharnri, dham sauchu meydath nrarnri Dham sauchu iinraim manrai, dham sauchu sagunr anrumanrai</p>
<p>Dham sauchu sal key chae, dham sauchu ii nrimalbhae 1. The virtue of contentment is a part and parcel of</p>
<p>religion; it is enthusiastic; it excels materialism; it gives utility to life; it relieves one from old age and</p>
