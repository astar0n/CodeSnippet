<p>It would be blame to me, and not praise, if I had. People</p>
<p>are put in the Hulks because they murder, and because they rob, and</p>
<p>forge, and do all sorts of bad; and they always begin by asking</p>
<p>questions. Now, you get along to bed! I was never allowed a candle</p>
<p>to light me to bed, and, as I went upstairs in the dark,</p>
<p>with my head tingling - from Mrs, Foe s thimble having played the</p>
<p>tambourine upon it, to accompany her last words - I felt fea/-fully sensible</p>
<p>of the great convenience that the Hulks were handy for me. I was</p>
<p>clearly on my way there. I had begun by asking questions, and I</p>
<p>was going to rob Mrs. ﬁoe. Since that time, which is far enough</p>
<p>away now, I have often thought that few people know what secrecy there</p>
<p>is in the young, under terror. No matter how unreasonable the terror, so</p>
<p>that it be terror. I was in mortal terror of the }"§ung man</p>
<p>who wanted my heart and liver; I was in mortal terror of my</p>
<p>interlocutor with the ironed leg; I was in mortal terror of myself, from</p>
<p>whom an awful promise 23 of 865 Great Expectations had been extracted;</p>
