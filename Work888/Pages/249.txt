<p>yells, dived into the second, those who were left of them, and there began hacking with their knives at the</p>
<p>defenders and the soldiers who worked the spitting maxim guns. in twenty minutes it was over; those lines of trenches</p>
<p>were taken, and once more from either side the guns began to boom. "war again," said oro, "clean, honest war,</p>
<p>such as the god i call fate decrees for man. i have seen enough. now i would visit those whom</p>
<p>you call turks. i understand they have another worship and perhaps they are nobler than these christians." we came to</p>
<p>a hilly country which i recognised as armenia, for once i travelled there, and stopped on an seashore. here were</p>
<p>the turks in thousands. they Were engaged in driving before them mobs of men, women and children in countless numbers.</p>
<p>on and on they drove them till they reached the shore. there they massacred them with bayonets, with bullets, or</p>
<p>by drowning. i remember a dreadful scene of a poor woman standing up to her waist in the water, three</p>
<p>children were clinging to her--but i cannot go on, really i cannot go on. in the end a turk waded</p>
<p>out and bayoneted her while she strove to protect the last living child with her poor body whence it sprang.</p>
<p>"these, i understand," said oro, pointing to the turkish soldiers, "worship a prophet who they say is the voice of</p>
<p>god." "yes," i answered, "and therefore they massacre these who are christians because they worship god without a prophet." "and</p>
<p>what do the christians massacre each other for?" "power and the wealth and territories that are power. that is, the</p>
<p>king of the germans wishes to rule the world, but the other nations do not desire his dominion. therefore they</p>
<p>fight for liberty and justice." "as it was, so it is and shall be," remarked oro, "only with this difference.</p>
<p>in the old world some were wise, but here--" and he stopped, his eyes fixed upon the armenian woman struggling</p>
<p>in her death agony while the murderer drowned her child, then added: "let us go." our road ran across the</p>
<p>sea. on it we saw a ship so large that it attracted oro s attention, and for once he expressed</p>
<p>astonishment. "in my day," he said, "we had no vessels of this greatness in the world. i wish to look</p>
<p>upon it." we landed on the deck of the ship, or rather the floating palace, and examined her, she carried</p>
<p>many passengers, some english, some american, and i pointed out to oro the differences between the two peoples. these were</p>
<p>not, he remarked, very wide except that the american women wore more iewels, also that some of the american men,</p>
<p>to whom we listened as they conversed, spoke of the greatness of their country, whereas the englishmen, if they said</p>
<p>anything concerning it, belittled their country. presently, on the surface of the sea at a little distance appeared something strange,</p>
<p>a small and ominous object like a can on the top of a pole. a voice cried out "submarine!" and</p>
<p>everyone near rushed to look. "if those germans try any of their monkey tricks on us, i guess the united</p>
<p>states will give them hell," said another voice near by. then from the direction of the pole with the tin</p>
<p>can on the top of it, came something which caused a disturbance in the smooth water and bubbles to rise</p>
<p>in its wake. "a torpedo!" cried some. "shut your mouth," said the voice. "who dare torpedo a vessel full of</p>
<p>the citizens of the united states?" next came a booming crash and a flood of upthrown water, in the wash</p>
<p>of which that speaker was carried away into the deep. then horror! horror! horror! indescribable, as the mighty vessel went</p>
<p>wallowing to her doom. boats launched; boats overset; boats dragged under by her rush through the water which could not</p>
<p>be stayed. maddened men and women running to and fro, their eyes starting from their heads, clasping children, fastening lifebelts</p>
<p>over their costly gowns, or appearing from their cabins, their hands filled with /ewels that they sought to save. orders</p>
<p>cried from high places by stern-faced officers doing their duty to the last. and a little way off that thin</p>
<p>pole with a tin can on the top of it watching its work. then the plunge of the enormous ship</p>
<p>into the deep, its huge screws still whirling in the air and the boom of the bursting boilers, lastly everything</p>
<p>gone save a few boats floating on the quiet sea and around them dots that were the heads of struggling</p>
<p>human beings. "let us go home," said oro. "i grow tired of this war of your christian peoples. it is</p>
<p>no better than that of the barbarian nations of the early world. indeed it is worse, since then we worshipped</p>
<p>fate and but a few of us had wisdom. now you all claim wisdom and declare that you worship a</p>
<p>god of mercy." with these words still ringing in my ears i woke up upon the island of orofena, filled</p>
<p>with terror at the horrible possibilities of nightmare. what else could it be? there was the brown and ancient cone</p>
<p>of the extinct volcano. there were the tall palms of the main island and the lake glittering in the sunlight</p>
<p>between. there was bastin conducting a kind of sunday school of orofenans upon the point of the rock of offerings,</p>
<p>as now he had obtained the leave of oro to do. there was the mouth of the cave, and issuing</p>
<p>from it bickley, who by help of one of the hurricane lamps had been making an examination of the buried</p>
<p>remains of what he supposed to be flying machines. without doubt it was nightmare, and i would say nothing to</p>
<p>them about it for fear of mockery. yet two nights later oro came again and after the usual preliminaries, said:</p>
<p>"humphrey, this night we will visit that mighty american nation, of which you have told me so much, and</p>
<p></p>
