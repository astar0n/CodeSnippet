<p>not control his laughter seeing this strange activity. ﬂokingly he said, "O abode of insects! what do you think you</p>
<p>are doing." You are gathering insects and considering this act to be a penance." The hermit remained calm the first</p>
<p>time, But when Gaushalak did not refrain from making biting remarks, the hermit looked at him with his burning eyes</p>
<p>and said, "O vicious person! My name is Vaisyayan Tapas and I am the doom of ignorant fools like you."</p>
<p>Instead of iolting him to sanity, this scornful comment drew an insulting laughter from Gaushalak. The hermit now took a</p>
<p>few steps back and angrily started emitting fire from his mouth (this is a miraculous power called Teioleshya, acquired through</p>
<p>long and harsh penance}. within no time, a ball of fire rushed towards Gaushalak, who retreated with fear and ran</p>
<p>to Mahavir shouting in panic, "Sire! Save me. This Tapas will burn me." Reaching Mahavir, Gaushalak fell at his feet.</p>
<p>Hearing the pathetic call of Gaushalak, Mahavir was moved. Turning back he saw the approaching fire ball. From the compassionate</p>
<p>heart of Shraman Mahavir flowed a spontaneous stream of cool pacifying energy. when the nectar-glance of Mahavir fell on the</p>
<p>fire-ball, it subsided. The angry hermit was astonished to see his fire-ball extinguished. He recognized Mahavir as a much greater</p>
<p>and more benevolent power than he, and said, "Pardon me, O embodiment of benevolence! I did not know that this</p>
<p>man was your disciple." Gaushalak was saved from his imminent death. Gaushalak was relieved. He asked, "Sire! what does this</p>
<p>abode of insects say?" Mahavir replied, "He was just going to turn you to ashes with his fire-power, You were</p>
<p>saved by me by my pacifying power. Do not disturb anyone in the future." AFFLIc"TIONS BY KATAPUTNA It was an</p>
<p>incident from the sixth year of the period of spiritual practices of Shraman Mahavir. It was the month of Magh,</p>
<p>the peak of winter season. Chilling and biting winds were blowing. During the quiet part of the night in a</p>
<p>lonely iungle, Mahavir was standing in meditation. All of a sudden, a witch named iéataputna came there. Seeing Mahavir deep</p>
<p>in meditation she became angry for no apparent reason. But there is nothing that happens without reason. There must certainly</p>
<p>been some antagonism from some previous birth. As soon as the feeling surfaced, kiataputna lost her reason, and, in order</p>
<p>to take her revenge of some forgotten deed from some past life, she started torturing Mahavir. She took the form</p>
<p>of a giant and ominous looking Parivraiak with long strands of hair, Filling ice cold water in her braided hair</p>
<p>she sprayed that freezing water on Mahavir. The atmosphere was filled with the moaning sound of icy winds and demonic</p>
<p>laughter of the witch. It Was a horrific scene. Mahavir, elevated completely into a higher spiritual realm, remained unmoved and</p>
<p>serene. At last the witch accepted her defeat. She bowed to the feet of Shraman Mahavir and left. As a</p>
<p>result of his total absorption in the self and his high purity of soul, Mahavir acquired the special mental powers</p>
<p>of perceiving the whole physical world at will. IN THE PRISON During the sixth year of his practices, Mahavir one</p>
<p>day went to the téupiya village in the state of Videh, east of Vaishali. The village guards caught him and,</p>
<p>taking him to be a spy, put him in prison. There were two female mendicants in the village, when they,</p>
<p>Viiay and Pragalbh, heard that a spy disguised as a nude ascetic had been apprehended, they came to see him.</p>
<p>Shraman Mahavir, tied up, was standing in meditation in the prison. The mendicants recognized him and became sad, They approached</p>
<p>the guards and said, "You call yourself guardians of the state and people and you fail to distinguish a thief</p>
<p>from a honest citizen. You do not find any difference between a Shraman and a smuggler. For your information, you</p>
<p>are torturing Shraman Vardhaman, the ascetic son of king Siddharth. Have you no fear of the wrath of the gods?"</p>
<p>with this revelation the soldiers started trembling. They, at once, released Mahavir and sought his forgiveness. Shraman Mahavir just raised</p>
<p>his palm a gesture of pardon and assurance and left for some other solitary place. DEADLY TORTURE BY SANGAM One</p>
<p>day Shraman Mahavir was doing a special one night meditation in the Polash temple in Pedhal garden outside the Pedhal</p>
<p>village. In this practice one makes his body, mind, psyche and soul absolutely still and tranquil. Observing the high degree</p>
<p>of engrossment in meditation, Indra exclaimed, "You are great, Prabhu Vardhaman! Today you have no equal as an ascetic and</p>
<p>serene, brave, and equanimous spiritualist." Sangam, a god in Indra s assembly, was peeved at this praise of a moral</p>
<p>being. He retorted, "If Devrai promises not to interfere, I can disturb the concentration of Mahavir. It is a child</p>
<p>s play for me." Indra remained silent, through unwillingly. Considering it to be affirmative, Sangam, with all his cunning and</p>
<p>power came to Polash temple. One after another he crated twenty almost fatal predicaments to disturb Mahavir s meditation. He</p>
<p>created a terrible sand storm an in no time Mahavir was submerged in a heap of sand. Mahavir, in his</p>
<p>unshakable determination did not even close his eyes. As soon as the storm stopped, arrived a swarm of ants. Mahavir</p>
<p>s body was covered with biting and stinging ants, but he remained still. After this, innumerable mosquito s attacked Mahavir</p>
<p>s body. After mosquitoes, came an attack by white ants turning him into a termite-hill. Scorpions crawled over his body</p>
<p>and pierced it with poisonous stings. This was followed by biting mongoose, large cobras, and giant field rats. After all</p>
<p>this, appeared a white elephant that goaded Mahavir with its large pointed tusks. This elephant than lifted Mahavir in its</p>
<p>trunks and tossed him up. when Mahavir fell on the ground, it crushed him with its legs. This was followed</p>
<p>by an attack by an ominous looking ghost. Then a tiger attacked and gored Mahavir with its sharp talons. when</p>
<p>all these painful afflictions failed to disturb Mahavir s meditation, Sangam took a different approach. He created a realistic illusion</p>
<p>of Siddharth and Trishla weeping and Wailing profusely. But this too could not penetrate Mahavir s iron resolve. Sangam then</p>
<p>lit a fire almost touching Mahavir s feet and started cooking. After this he took the form of a bird</p>
<p>catcher and hung a number of cages on Mahavir. The birds attacked Mahavir with their beaks and talons through the</p>
<p>gaps in the cages. Blood oozed from these new wounds. Then came a storm, torrential rain, and hail-storm. Nothing</p>
