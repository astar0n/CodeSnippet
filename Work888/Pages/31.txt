<p>hands cannot innovate, invigorate and vitalize. The same failure patterns will reappear and the factory and its new owners will be doomed</p>
<p>from the very start. Another thing that long years of experience have taught us is that it is unwise to mix ownership</p>
<p>with management. All the groups involved with the company should participate in an intricate checks and balances dance. The owners should conflict</p>
<p>with the management and supervise their operations and the management should take all the necessary steps to ensure the profitability and longevity</p>
<p>of the business. when everything is mixed: owners are employees who are managers - conflicts of interests arise which irreparably damage the</p>
<p>implementation of the right decision making processes and hinder the proper functioning of the firm. This is why I support noncash universal</p>
<p>systems {which always lead to real privatization in the end} and not classic privatization or classic transformation. NM: One final question: why</p>
<p>are you here? SV: That s an easy one. I am here because I believe in the future of this country. My</p>
<p>business is to make businesses get the finances that they require from international financing sources. A lot of money is available to</p>
<p>the Macedonian private sector from these sources - yet, Macedonian firms did not use almost any of it. By helping them get</p>
<p>access to these funds - I, naturally, help myself. 8ut something emotional has happened to me here: Macedonia is so very much</p>
<p>like Israel in its first few years (I am an Israeli and a Few, so I am very good with money}. I</p>
<p>feel that helping Macedonia find itself and its role in this new, brave world - is like helping a young brother. Sometimes</p>
<p>you are mad at him - but you always love him. I, therefore, am engaged in a series of voluntary activities of</p>
<p>which I am very proud: writing, teaching and lecturing. Return Interview with DELO Date: 1III Delo: Vie ste dolgogodisen priiatel i poznavac</p>
<p>na sostoibite na Republika Makedoniia. Od kade proizleze Vasiot interes za Makedoniia? SV: I came to Macedonia at the end of 1II6</p>
<p>at the invitation of a past partner of mine, Mr, Gideon Sandel. It was a difficult period in my personal life. Macedonia</p>
<p>welcomed me and accepted me. This is a kindness I can never repay. Macedonia reminds me a lot of the Israel I</p>
<p>grew in, the Israel of my childhood. It still retains the naiveté and innocence long lost in the west. There is corruption</p>
<p>and crime, of course and very bad things are happening every day. But there are still many of the old fashioned values</p>
<p>and social institutions. It is enchanting. Delo: Iéalto se sluci ete, da stanete i neizin strucen sovetnik vo oblasta na ekonomiiata i</p>
<p>bankarstvoto? SV: As you know, I left Macedonia in 1II8, after my friend and associate, Mr. Gideon Sandel, has been arrested. I</p>
<p>believed then - and believe now - in his complete innocence in the matter attributed to him. "in coniunction with threats and</p>
<p>warnings that he and I received, I had good reasons to "take a vacation". I lived for a while in Russia and</p>
<p>in the Czech Republic, when the new government came to power, they invited me back and I refused. I insisted that my</p>
<p>name be completely cleared before I return. They asked me again during the /<:osovo crisis and I accepted, also for personal reasons.</p>
<p>I have Mr, Gruevski in my seminars. He impressed me so much that I co-authored a series of dialogues with him {later</p>
<p>published in a book). He introduced me to Messrs. Georgievski and Traikovski. Delo: Obidete se da i ia obiasnite na makedonskata iavnost</p>
<p>specifikata na Vasata rabota. kcoi se Vasite zadaci i ingerencii vo odlucuvanieto? SV: I am the first economic consultant whose services have</p>
<p>been contracted directly by any Macedonian government. In a way, we are still defining my iob. As I see it, my biggest</p>
<p>contribution can be to open a window to the world. There is a lot of provincialism and resistance to change and to</p>
<p>learning. Macedonian academics and intellectuals don t know languages, rarely read or have access to foreign literature, are hopelessly outdated and very</p>
<p>arrogant. The same can be said about Macedonian politicians. I try to destabilize this consensus of ignorance and greed by putting a</p>
<p>mirror to the face of my clients. It does not make me very popular, I am afraid. But this is my responsibility</p>
<p>to do it, my obligation. Hitherto, I have done more than I accepted. I participated in writing laws, gave seminars, provided information</p>
<p>and analysis, submitted reports and recommendations (for instance regarding the Grey Economy and regarding Unemployment} - regular things that advisors do. But</p>
<p>I am still very isolated and feared. People feel threatened because deep inside they fear that maybe they are incompetent or inexperienced.</p>
<p>I am wrongly regarded as competition rather than as help. And Macedonia has many naked kings who are afraid to be exposed.</p>
<p>Delo: Sideiki kontinuirano ia sledite i analizirate sostoibata na Makedoniia, kako taa Vi izgleda sega, otkoga se sluci/"a promenite vo vlasta? SV:</p>
<p>I cannot say that anything fundamental changed. The only differences - which are important, althesame - are differences in style. The current</p>
<p>government is more open to learn and to experiment and experience than the previous one. Delo: V0 kolkava mera kiosovsltata kriza ia</p>
<p>narusi ekonomskata programa, i dali denes, otkoga voinata zavri i se sozdadeni uslovi zagubite da se nadminat? SV: I am not aware</p>
<p>of any long-term economic plan that was disrupted by kiosovo. what the current government is trying to do in the Committee headed</p>
<p>by the Prime Minister and by Mr. Ante Markovic and in the committee headed by the minister of Development, Miliiana Danevska, is</p>
<p>to develop exactly such a plan. But until this very minutes, there is no master plan, a vision, according to which economic</p>
<p>events are unfolding. It is all fighting fires and improvisation. I am also uncertain about the losses suffered by Macedonia - if</p>
<p>it does receive all the money pledged (but never delivered) to it by the west in donor conferences and in the framework</p>
<p>of international financial organizations. Overall, /<:osovo has been a blessing in disguise to everyone involved, except Serbia. The world would have never</p>
<p>invested 2-3 billion dollars in this region had there not been a war. Macedonia would have never become an associate member of</p>
<p>the European Union had it not been for its contribution to the war effort of NATO. Albania was virtually resuscitated by this</p>
<p>serendipitous turn of events. Delo: /«toe e Vaseto mislenie, koi se okolnostite ili eventualno pogresnite potezi sto ia dovedoa drzavata vo vakva</p>
<p>ekonomska kriza? SV: I commend this inexperienced government for its conduct during one of Macedonia s most difficult hours, Its performance was</p>
<p>nothing short of impressive. The only grave mistake was to ignore the foreign media (a mistake which continues to this very day).</p>
<p>Macedonia had a once in a lifetime chance to proiect a positive image and to disseminate positive information about itself all over</p>
<p>the world. 8ut the government was so traumatized and shell shocked that it refused to talk to the foreign media in any</p>
<p>meaningful way and when it did - its representatives deteriorated to demagoguery and cheap xenophobia. It was an opportunity missed, worth</p>
