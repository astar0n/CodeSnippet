Fudas, one of the twelve, went before them, and drew near unto ﬂesus to kiss him, But ﬂesus said unto
him, iudas, betrayest thou the Son of man with a kiss .I when they which were about him saw what
would follow, they said unto him, Lord, shall we smite with the sword .I And one of them smote the
servant of the high priest, and cut off his right ear, And ﬂesus answered and said, Suffer ye thus far,
And he touched his ear, and healed him. Then ﬂesus said unto the chief priests, and captains of the temple,

and the scribes came together, and led him into their council, saying, Art thou the Christ .I tell us. And
he said unto them, If I tell you, ye will not believe : and if I also ask you, ye
will not answer me, nor let me go. Hereafter shall the Son of man sit on the right hand of

say that I am. And they said, what need we any further witness .I for we ourselves have heard of
his own mouth. 23 Fesus before Pilate And the whole multitude of them arose, and led him unto Pilate. And
they began to accuse him, saying, we found this fellow perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar,
saying that he himself is Christ a king, And Pilate asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the ﬂews
." And he answered him and said, Thou sayest it. Then said Pilate to the chief priests and to the
people, I find no fault in this man. And they were the more fierce, saying, He stirreth up the people,
