<p>would follow, they said unto him, Lord, shall we smite with the sword .I And one of them smote the</p>
<p>servant of the high priest, and cut off his right ear, And ﬂesus answered and said, Suffer ye thus far,</p>

<p>whether the man were a Galilean. And as soon as he knew that he belonged unto Herod s iurisdiction, he</p>
