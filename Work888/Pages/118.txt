the capacity to hurt the narcissist by rejecting him or by abandoning him - and he feels that they flaunt this power.
This realisation cannot coexist with a feeling of omnipotence. To restore the proper balance of power, the narcissist must frustrate women. He
must re-acquire his superior position of iudgement and decision-making, women are anti-narcissistic agents, They are perceived by the narcissist to have an
all-pervading, all-penetrating X-rays look, the kind that might reach the narcissist s TRUE Self. This is a real threat. These ominous supernatural
capacities evoke strong emotional reactions in the narcissist." The Concept of Narcissistic Supply - Sam Vaknin http://samvak.tripod.com/msla6.html "Question: An adult narcissist, in
other words, is still stuck in his terrible twos and is possessed with the emotional maturity of a toddler. Does the narcissist
want to be liked? Answer: would you wish to be liked by your television set? To the narcissist, people are mere tools,
Sources of Supply. "If he must be liked by them in order to secure this supply - he strives to make sure
they like him. "if he can only be feared - he makes sure they fear him. He does not really care either
way as long as he is being attended to. Attention - whether in the form of fame or infamy - is what
it s all about. His world revolves around his constant mirroring. I am seen therefore "I exist, sayeth the narcissist. Additionally, narcissists
get tired of their sources. There is no mathematical formula, which governs this, "it depends on numerous variables. Usually, the relationship lasts
until the narcissist gets used to the source and its stimulating effects wear off OR until a better Source of Supply presents
itself." Ask Sam Vaknin http://groups.msn.com/NARCISSISTICPERSONA€—ITYD"ISORDER/general.msnw?action=get_message&mview=06tIZ>_Message=15404 http://groups.msn.com/PSYCHOPATH/general.msnw?action=get_message&mview=0&"i2>_Message=I350 "The narcissist often strikes people are laid back - or
self-indulgent. But, as usual with narcissists, appearances deceive. Narcissists are either compulsively driven over-achievers - or chronic under-achieving wastrels." whistling in the
Dark - Sam Vaknin http://samvak.tripodcom/iournal58.html "The abused are often on the verge of a nervous breakdown: harassed, unkempt, irritable, impatient, abrasive, and
hysterical. Confronted with this contrast between a polished, self-controlled, and suave abuser and his harried casualties - it is easy to reach
the conclusion that the real victim is the abuser, or that both parties abuse each other equally. The prey s acts of
self-defence, assertiveness, or insistence on her rights are interpreted as aggression." Pathologising the Victim - Sam Vaknin (from "Toxic Relationships - Abuse
and its Aftermath", 2004) http://groups.msn.com/NARC"ISS"IST"ICPERSONAL"ITYZ>"ISORZ>ER/toxicrelationshipspathologizingthevictim.msnw "Better to play ball and adopt the sleek mannerisms of your abuser. Sadly, sometimes the only way
to convince your therapist that it is not all in your head and that you are a victim - is by being
insincere and by staging a well-calibrated performance, replete with the correct vocabulary. Therapists have Pavlovian reactions to certain phrases and theories and
to certain presenting signs and symptoms (behaviours during the first few sessions}. Learn these - and use them to your advantage. It
is your only chance." Pathologising the Victim - Sam Vaknin (from "Toxic Relationships - Abuse and its Aftermath", 2004) http://groups.msn.com/NARCISSIST"iCPERSONALITYZ>ISORDER/toxicrelationshipspathologizingthevictim.msnw "when his
sources become weary, rebellious, tired, bored, disgusted, repelled, or plainly amused by the narcissist s incessant dependence, his childish craving for attention,
his exaggerated or even paranoid fears which lead to obsessive-compulsive behaviours, and his drama queen temper tantrums - he resorts to emotional
extortion, straight blackmail, abuse, or misuse of his authority, and criminal or antisocial conduct. "if these fail, the narcissist devalues and discards
the very people he so idealised and cherished only a short while before. Nor is the narcissist deterred by possible punishment or
regards himself sub/ect to Man-made laws. His sense of entitlement Coupled with the conviction of his own superiority lead him to believe
in his invincibility, invulnerability, immunity, and divinity. The narcissist holds human edicts, rules, and regulations in disdain and human penalties in disdain.
He regards human needs and emotions as weaknesses to be predatorily exploited." The Professions of the Narcissist - Sam Vaknin http://www.suite101.com/article.cfm/npd/103814 "Choosing
to live with an abuser is like opting to share a cage with a predator. No matter how domesticated, Nature is bound
to prevail. You are more likely than not to end up as the abuser s next meal." Avoiding the Abuser - I.
The Submissive Posture - Sam Vaknin http://www.suite101.com/article.cfm/I128/103326 "To your abuser, you are an object, no matter how ostensibly revered and cherished, Hence
the battering. He monopolises your time and your mind. He makes for you even the minutest choices: what to wear, what to
cook for dinner, when to go out and with whom. "in extreme cases, he regards even your body as his to share
with others, if he sees fit." Avoiding the Abuser - I. The Submissive Posture - Sam Vaknin http://www.suite101.com/article.cfm/I128/103326 "Primary Narcissistic Supply (PNS)
is ANY kind of NS provided by others who are not meaningful or significant others. Adulation, attention, affirmation, fame, notoriety, sexual conquests
- are all forms of PNS. Secondary NS ISNSJ emanates from people who are in CONSTANT, repetitive or continuous touch with the
narcissist. It includes the important roles of Narcissistic Accumulation and Narcissistic Regulation, among others," Narcissists and women- - Sam Vaknin http://samvak.tripod.com/faqI_I,html "what
does pain mean to narcissists? Do they feel pain emotionally? when "I use terms like pain and envy , they mean normal
feelings of pain and envy. Narcissists feel negative emotions as all others do. They suppress only their positive emotions and replace them
with false substitutes {Narcissistic Supply instead of love, for instance}. Narcissists are pompous, grandiose, repulsive and contradictory. There is a serious mismatch
between who they really are and what they really achieve - and how they feel about themselves. "It is not that the
narcissist merely Tl-i"IN/<S that he is far superior to other humans intellectually. The perception of his superiority is ingrained in him, it
is a part of his every mental cell, an all-pervasive sensation, an instinct and a drive. He feels that he is entitled
to special treatment and to outstanding consideration because he is such a unique specimen. He knows this to be true - the
same way one knows that one is surrounded by air." 00 Narcissists Have Emotions." - Sam Vaknin httpr//www.narcissistic-abuse.com/faq33.html "The narcissist feels entitled
to and deserving of ever increasing amounts of Narcissistic Supply. Narcissism is a drug addiction: as doses consumed increase - the impact
(elation, happiness ) decreases. The addict needs progressively more to maintain his high. Additionally, it is not realistic to expect the narcissist
never to encounter disagreement or criticism. Hence, narcissistic rage and abusive behaviours are inevitable." Ask Sam Vaknin http://groups.msn.com/NARC"?SS"IST"ICPERSONAr_"ITYD"ISORDER/general.msnw?action=get_message&mview=0&I2>_Message=15404 "Don t make excuses

has no mercy on you - you, in return, do not harbour misplaced pity for him. Never give him a second chance.
React with your full arsenal to the first transgression. Teach him a lesson he is unlikely to forget. Make him go elsewhere
