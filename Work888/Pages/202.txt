<p>him somehow twice as pitiful. his big atlas, from which papers projected, seemed forgotten by his side. so he sat</p>
<p>for a long time, and neither he nor letty moved or spoke. but they were in the same shadow. they</p>
<p>found great comfort in one another. they had not been so comforted before since their losses came upon them, it</p>
<p>was mr. britling who broke silence. and when he drew his hands down from his face and spoke, he said</p>
<p>one of the most amazing and unexpected things she had ever heard in her life. "the only possible government in</p>
<p>albania," he said, looking steadfastly before him down the hill-side, "is a group of republican cantons after the swiss pattern.</p>
<p>i can see no other solution that is not offensive to god. it does not matter in the least what</p>
<p>we owe to serbia or what we owe to italy. we have got to set this world on a different</p>
<p>footing. we have got to set up the world at last -- on justice and reason." then, after a pause,</p>
<p>"the treaty of bucharest was an evil treaty. it must be undone. whatever this german king of bulgaria does, that</p>
<p>treaty must be undone and the bulgarians united again into one people. they must have themselves, whatever punishment they deserve,</p>
<p>they must have nothing more, whatever reward they win." she could not believe her ears. "after this precious blood, after</p>
<p>this precious blood, if we leave one plot of wickedness or cruelty in the world -- " and therewith he</p>
<p>began to lecture letty on the importance of international politics -- to every one. how he and she and every</p>
<p>one must understand, however hard it was to understand. "no life is safe, no happiness is safe, there is no</p>
<p>chance of bettering life until we have made an end to all that causes war.... "we have to put an</p>
<p>end to the folly and vanity of kings, and to any people ruling any people but themselves. there is no</p>
<p>convenience, there is no justice in any people ruling any people but themselves; the ruling of men by others, who</p>
<p>have not their creeds and their languages and their ignorances and preiudices, that is the fundamental folly that has killed</p>
<p>teddy and hugh -- and these millions. to end that folly is as much our duty and business as telling</p>
<p>the truth or earning a living...." "but how can you alter it?" he held out a finger at her. "men</p>
<p>may alter anything if they have motive enough and faith enough." he indicated the atlas beside him. "here i am</p>
<p>planning the real map of the world," he said. "every sort of district that has a character of its own</p>
<p>must have its own rule; and the great republic of the united states of the world must keep the federal</p>
<p>peace between them all. that s the plain sense of life; the federal world-republic. why do we bother ourselves with</p>
<p>loyalties to any other government but that? it needs only that sufficient men should say it, and that republic would</p>
<p>be here now. why have we loitered so long -- until these tragic punishments come? we have to map the</p>
<p>world out into its states, and plan its government and the way of its tolerations." "and you think it will</p>
<p>come?" "it will come." "and you believe that men will listen to such schemes?" said letty. mr. britling, with his</p>
<p>eyes far away over the hills, seemed to think. "yes," he said, "not perhaps to-day -- not steadily, but kings</p>
<p>and empires die; great ideas, once they are born, can never die again. in the end this world-republic, this sane</p>
<p>government of the world, is as certain as the sunset. only,,,_" he sighed, and turned over a page of his</p>
<p>atlas blindly. "only we want it soon. the world is weary of this bloodshed, weary of all this weeping, of</p>
<p>this wasting of substance and this killing of sons and lovers. we want it soon, and to have it soon</p>
<p>we must work to bring it about. we must give our lives. what is left of our lives.... "that is</p>
<p>what you and i must do, letty. what else is there left for us to do?... i will write of</p>
<p>nothing else, i will think of nothing else now but of safety and order. so that all these dear dead</p>
<p>-- not one of them but will have brought the great days of peace and man s real beginning nearer,</p>
<p>and these cruel things that make men whimper like children, that break down bright lives into despair and kill youth</p>
<p>at the very moment when it puts out its clean hands to take hold of life -- these cruelties, these</p>
<p>abominations of confusion, shall cease from the earth forever." letty regarded him, frowning, and with her chin between her fists....</p>
<p>"but do you really believe," said letty, "that things can be better than they are?" "but -- yes!" said mr.</p>
<p>britling. "i don t," said letty. "the world is cruel. it is just cruel. so it will always be." "it</p>
<p>need not be cruel," said mr. britling. "it is just a place of cruel things. it is all set with</p>
<p>knives. it is full of diseases and accidents. as for god -- either there is no god or he is</p>
<p>an idiot. he is a slobbering idiot. he is like some idiot who pulls off the wings of flies." no,"</p>
<p>said mr. britling. "there is no progress. nothing gets better. how can you believe in god after hugh? do you</p>
<p>believe in god?" "yes," said mr. britling after a long pause," "i do believe in god." "who lets these things</p>
<p>happen!" she raised herself on her arm and thrust her argument at him with her hand. "who kills my teddy</p>
<p>and your hugh -- and millions." "no," said mr. britling. "but he must let these things happen. or why do</p>
<p>they happen?" "no," said mr. britling. "it is the theologians who must answer that. they have been extravagant about</p>
<p></p>
