<p>i can claim the office of acting commandant de place. . . ." bartholomew yelled up at him. "you can</p>
<p>claim whatever you like, you pimp. but no englishman ll sail for you, an that s a fact, we ll</p>
<p>spike these cannon if you re thinking to try any of the old tricks. it s a new day, by</p>
<p>all that s holy." "what do you mean?" de fontenay glanced down. "i mean from this day forth we ll</p>
<p>sail for whatever master we ve a mind to." de fontenay called to winston. "you saw who killed him, monsieur,</p>
<p>tell them." he looked back toward bartholomew. "this man knew iacques better than any of you. his friend, the anglais,</p>
<p>from the very first days of the boucaniers. he will tell you the code makes me . . ." "anglais!"</p>
<p>bartholomew stared at winston a moment, then a smile erupted across his hard face. "good god, i do believe it</p>
<p>is. you ve aged mightily, lad, on my honor. please take no offense i didn t recognize you before." "it</p>
<p>s been a long time." "god s blood, none of us ever knew your christian name, we all thought you</p>
<p>dead after you and iacques had that little shooting spree." he grasped winston s hand. "do you have any idea</p>
<p>how proud we were of you? i tell you we all saw it when you pulled a pistol on that</p>
<p>bastard. you may not know it, sir, but it was because of you his band of french rogues didn t</p>
<p>rape that english frigate. all the englishmen amongst us wanted to stop it, but we had no chance." he laughed.</p>
<p>"in truth, sir, that was the start of all our troubles here. we never got along with the damn d</p>
<p>Frenchmen after that. articles or no. "hugh, what s he saying?" katherine was staring at him. "what do you mean?"</p>
<p>"is it true you stopped iacques and his men from taking our ship? the one you were talking about tonight?"</p>
<p>"the idea was we were only to kill spaniards. no englishman had done anything to us, it wouldn t have</p>
<p>been honorable. when iacques didn t agree with me on that point, things got a little unpleasant, that s when</p>
<p>somebody started firing on the ship." "aye, the damn d frenchmen," bartholomew interiected. "i was there, sir." "i m sorry</p>
<p>the rest of us didn t manage to warn you in time." winston slipped his arm around her, suddenly she</p>
<p>wanted to smother him in her arms, "but do you realize you must have saved my life? they would have</p>
<p>killed us all." "they doubtless would have. eventually." he reached over and kissed her, then drew back and examined her.</p>
<p>"katy, i have a confession to make. i think i can still remember watching you. when i was in the</p>
<p>longboat, trying to reach the ship. i think i fell in love with you that morning. with that brave girl</p>
<p>who stood there at the railing, musket balls flying. i never forgot it, in all the years, my god, to</p>
<p>think it was you." he held her against him for a moment, then lifted up her face, "which also means</p>
<p>i have you and yours to thank for trying to kill me, when i wanted to get out to where</p>
<p>you were." "the captain just assumed you were one of them. i heard him talk about it after, nobody had</p>
<p>any idea . . ." she hugged him. "you and your honor. you changed my life." "you and that ship</p>
<p>sure as hell changed mine. after i fell in love with you, i damned near died of thirst in that</p>
<p>leaky longboat. and then ruyters . ." "capitaine, please tell them i was the one who shot iacques. that</p>
<p>i am now commandant de place. " de fontenay interrupted, his voice pleading. "that i have the authority to order</p>
<p>them "you re not ordering anything, by iesus. i m about to put an end to any more french orders</p>
<p>here and now." bartholomew seized a burning stick from the fire in the boucan and flung it upward, onto the</p>
<p>veranda of the "dovecote." a cheer went up from the english seamen clustered around, and before jacques s french guards</p>
<p>could stop them, they were flinging torches and flaming logs up into the citadel, "messieurs, no, please! /"e vous en</p>
<p>prie. non!" de fontenay stared up in horror. tongues of flame began to lick at the edge of the platform.</p>
<p>some of the guards dropped their muskets and yelled to get buckets of water from the spring behind the rock,</p>
<p>then they thought better of it and started edging gingerly toward the iron gates leading out of the fortress and</p>
<p>down the hill. the other guards who had been rifling the liquor came scurrying down the ladder, iostling de fontenay</p>
<p>aside. as winston urged katherine toward the gates, the young matelot was still lingering forlornly on the steps, gazing up</p>
<p>at the burning "dovecote." finally, the last to leave forte de la roche, he sadly turned and made his way</p>
<p>out. "senhor, what is happening here?" atiba was racing up the steps leading to the gate, carrying his cutlass.</p>
<p>swam to shore and came fastly as i could." "there s been a little revolution up here, my friend. and</p>
<p>i ll tell you something else. there s likely to be some gunpowder in that citadel. for those demi-culverin. i</p>
<p>don t have any idea how many kegs he had, but knowing iacques, there was enough." he took katherine s</p>
<p>hand. "it s the end for this place, that much you can be sure." "hugh, what about the plan to</p>
<p>use his men?" she turned back to look. "we ll just have to see how things here are going to</p>
<p>settle out now. maybe it s not over yet." they moved onto the tree-lined pathway. the night air was sharp,</p>
<p>fragrant. above the glow of the fire, the moon hung like a lantern in the tropical sky. "you know,</p>
<p>"i</p>
