<p>in rhythm with his thoughts. algors; a race akin to the lizards, forming communities, yet living solitary lifestyles in the</p>
<p>vast reaches of the desert. he knew so little about them. mappel said they spoke in the same language. that</p>
<p>in itself was difficult to imagine, large upright lizards holding a conversation. the image was laughable. yet, was that not</p>
<p>the point of his mission? as absurd as it seemed, his main goal was to meet and talk with the</p>
<p>algors, to convince them of the danger to the land and all of its inhabitants. here he was, already in</p>
<p>the desert, already following the thin veneer of signs that led him to this canyon. in the end, he returned</p>
<p>to the very things which brought him to this place. he turned to his inner most feelings. he hoped his</p>
<p>own deepest instincts would guide him to a decision, /"ust as they guided him through the desert. if he expected</p>
<p>to meet with the algors to explain the breach in sanctum and the threat of the sphere, he would have</p>
<p>to gain their trust. with that thought, he gained the answer to his question. they would wait here in the</p>
<p>open, wait for the algors to acknowledge them. how could he expect them to trust him, if he did not</p>
<p>trust them first? he made his decision known to holli by yelling out to the canyon wall and the many</p>
<p>openings within it. "algors! my name is ryson acumen. i m a delver. i am with holli brances, an elf.</p>
<p>we are here to speak with you." his words echoed only slightly overhead against the cliff face. after that, the</p>
<p>hot desert air swept them away. no other sound graced the area until ryson continued. "all the races must speak</p>
<p>together! the sphere of ingar is free from sanctum! we can tell you what we know, but we must meet</p>
<p>with you." he lowered his head, and his voice, as he turned his attention to holli. "let s make camp</p>
<p>here. we have to show them that we trust them. i really don t think they ll attack us anyway.</p>
<p>they ll either come down, or they ll ignore us. we ll just have to wait and see." "we will</p>
<p>not have to wait at all," holli stated abruptly. her face was expressionless, the demeanor of an elf guard facing</p>
<p>the unknown. her eyes narrowed as they scanned the entirety of the canyon wall. while she fought off her own</p>
<p>instincts to pull her sword, she nodded for ryson to look back. ryson caught his breath as he turned. in</p>
<p>all of his experiences over the past few days, nothing could prepare him for this bizarre spectacle. meeting an elf</p>
<p>was one thing, this sight yanked at his grip on sanity. even seeing the ghost of shayed could not compare</p>
<p>to what he now witnessed. like a legion of ants flowing from their anthill, countless algors erupted from the openings</p>
<p>which abounded across the sandstone. within mere moments, nearly every cave entrance spat out algors. an endless flow of yellowish</p>
<p>green flowed down the canyon wall toward them. they climbed downward with casual ease, each algor moving in concert with</p>
<p>the next, so as every apparent space of the cliff face was covered. at first it was difficult for the</p>
<p>delver to center his attention upon a single algor. their coordinated movements kept ryson scanning the growing flock as a</p>
<p>single entity. like a shifting, diving, turning school of fish, the moving multitude attracted attention from every angle and direction,</p>
<p>not one algor moved in opposition, not one algor stalled or paused. step by step, foothold by foothold, lines of</p>
<p>algors moved as if directed by a single consciousness, it was like watching a parade of well trained soldiers, soldiers</p>
<p>that spent years together so that every movement was in precise order. the delver and the elf marveled at the</p>
<p>whole spectacle. never had either witnessed such a display. even the elf guard could not boast of such precise coordination</p>
<p>of movement. it seemed impossible, as if the desert had finally taken control of their minds. it was not until</p>
<p>the algors began their final approach towards them, that they were able to break free from the hold of the</p>
<p>group movement. as the first wave of algors reached the desert floor and stepped toward him, ryson gasped out the</p>
<p>breath he had held. he inspected their physical characteristics with as much wonder as he watched their movements. an upright</p>
<p>toad, as tall as he was, was the only way he could describe them. large black eyes bulged near the</p>
<p>top of every head. two holes formed nostrils at the end of the rounded snouts that iutted forward. the mouth</p>
<p>opening crested wide, far back to the round greenish brown cheeks. not much of a forehead existed, merely a space</p>
<p>above and between the two eyes. the top of their heads curved slightly before dropping down to a wide neck.</p>
<p>small purple bumps took the place of hair. as for their bodies, the algors wore no cloak to hide their</p>
<p>scaly chest which was more yellow than green. long thin arms hung nimbly from somewhat droopy shoulders. long narrow legs,</p>
<p>which appeared quite flexible, held the light weight of the algor easily. claws tipped the thin fingers and toes and</p>
<p>webbing filled the spaces between each. just as the legends described, there was no sign of a tail, more and</p>
<p>more of the algors filed down the sandstone mountain and encircled the two messengers. they left a small space around</p>
<p>ryson and holli as they formed an unbroken circle all the way around, but they left little room for themselves.</p>
<p>they clumped themselves together in a growing, continuous ring, hardly leaving enough room to breathe. arms appeared interlocked as they</p>
<p>stood hip to hip and shoulder to shoulder. the chests of those that stood behind the inner ring pressed flat</p>
<p>against the backs of those in front of them, and so it was for each ring which spread back</p>
<p></p>
