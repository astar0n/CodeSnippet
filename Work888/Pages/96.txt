<p>showing all the cards in his hand. he had something mafor, and unexpected, in the pipeline. which brought forth the</p>
<p>next insight." matsuo noda didn t hire me merely because he wanted some innocent-seeming outsider to do his bidding in</p>
<p>the futures market." any number of players in this town could have handled that action as well or better, no,</p>
<p>he d sucked me into his operation for some entirely different purpose, at the moment known only to him. but</p>
<p>what? more to the point, why? welcome to friday, and my rather disturbed life. want to know what really disturbed</p>
<p>me the most? seeing my new employer on cnn s prime news, standing there right next to the emperor of</p>
<p>iapan. seemed as though i wasn t the only one now under noda s spell. all of a sudden my</p>
<p>mild-mannered client had become a world-class iapanese mover and shaker. and that made me very nervous. needing a little perspective,</p>
<p>i decided to invite down dr. william /". henderson, respected thinker and booze hound. as it happened, he had a</p>
<p>little time to kill that friday before his "late date" with some advertising exec who was flying in from an</p>
<p>assignment on the coast. since three weeks had gone by since our talk up at martell s, it seemed like</p>
<p>a good occasion to get together and compare notes. true to his word, he had formally resigned from the president</p>
<p>s council of economic advisers, though he d reluctantly agreed to serve as a forecasting consultant for wharton econometrics. he</p>
<p>d also caused some unsettling rumors in the world markets by putting on some very heavy "straddles" in december gold</p>
<p>futures and oil. he called it insurance, predicting he d be covered no matter what happened. looked at another way,</p>
<p>though, bill henderson was quietly shifting out of paper money and into commodities. and when hender-son started hedging, you knew</p>
<p>the weather forecast was unsettled to stormy. it turned out he d also uncovered a few stray elements of what</p>
<p>might well be a much bigger game. nothing solid at that point, but enough to stir him up. "know who</p>
<p>runs that outfit you ve taken on as a client?" he leaned back in one of the leather chairs in</p>
<p>the upstairs parlor, new pair of gucci s glistening, and sampled his third drink. "guy by the name of matsuo</p>
<p>noda," "henderson, who do you think i was talking to up at sotheby s the other night?" "you check your</p>
<p>wallet afterward? we re talking heavy guns, my friend." he snubbed out what must have been his tenth dunhill in</p>
<p>the last hour. "you didn t tell me he was the honcho behind all this." "you didn t ask. know</p>
<p>anything about him?" "not till last week. i started to do a little checking and first thing i know i</p>
<p>m stumbling across his name everywhere i look." he studied the glass in his hand. "tell you something about this</p>
<p>noda. the man drops a quarter, you let him pick it up himself. he ll nail you where the sun</p>
<p>don t shine. definitely a bad news mother." ".Vou mean that business with the sword?" "nah, what in hell do</p>
<p>i know about swords? that s your toy box. i m talking about the real world, friend. turns out matsuo</p>
<p>noda was the prime mover in one of the biggest takeover plays of the century." "what takeover? they don t</p>
<p>screw around with corporate takeovers in iapan." "they don t take each other over, they take other businesses over. washington</p>
<p>may think that war back in the forties is over, but somebody neglected to pass the word to miti. seems</p>
<p>they ve got the idea it was just the opening skirmish-the only folks who surrendered were the army and navy."</p>
<p>henderson grew ominously serious for a change. "question is, where s this thing headed? is the idea of turning our</p>
<p>industrial base into a packaging operation for imports some kind of conspiracy, or is it just nature takin its course?"</p>
<p>conspiracy? that wasn t a word henderson threw around lightly. in fact, he tended to scoff at conspiracy theories, claiming</p>
<p>they were a substitute for hardheaded analysis. i agreed. so what was he driving at? i pressed him. he paused</p>
<p>to light a cigarette. "i bring up this unsavory possibility because i m beginning to detect a little operation code-named</p>
<p>eat an industry. " "henderson, that s my game. i pitch in to help the little fish fend off the</p>
<p>big ones." "no offense, friend, but you probably couldn t even get into the ball park where noda and his</p>
<p>boys are playing. we re talking the very big leagues here." "now hold on a second. noda s not interested</p>
<p>in companies. he s /"ust shooting a little craps. from what i ve seen so far, the guy seems to</p>
<p>be completely on the up-and-up. in fact, looked at from the long view, you might even say he s putting</p>
<p>money into this country, never mind it s just the wall street casino." "sure he is. it s like he</p>
<p>first kicks the shit out of you, then hands you a coke so s you ll feel refreshed." "what in</p>
<p>hell are you talking about?" "well, let s back up a notch. since i don t want to bad-mouth your</p>
<p>new client, why don t you let me give you what i ll call a purely hypothetical case." he sipped</p>
<p>at his scotch. "let s suppose you were a iapanese guy, like matsuo noda for instance, and you wanted to</p>
<p>take over some strategic american industry and ship it to iapan. how d you go about it?" "well . .</p>
<p>." "have a drink, counselor." he Plunged forward. "and let me tell you a little fairy tale. about how matsuo</p>
<p>noda ate the american semiconductor industry." "noda?" "it was miti actually. but noda was running the ministry when they did</p>
<p>it, and he was the guy who set up the play." "noda ran miti?" this was news to me.</p>
