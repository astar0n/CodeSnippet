<p>was very 161 of 1241 Of Human Bondage much distressed. He was unkind</p>
<p>and unchristian. He must know they Were only trying to do their best</p>
<p>for him, and they Were so much older than he that they must</p>
<p>be better iudges of what was good for him. Philip clenched his hands.</p>
<p>He had heard that statement so often, and he could not see why</p>
<p>it was true; they did not know the conditions as he did, why</p>
<p>should they accept it as self-evident that their greater age gave them greater</p>
<p>wisdom? The letter ended with the information that Mr. Carey had withdrawn the</p>
<p>notice he had given, Philip nursed his wrath till the next half-holiday. They</p>
<p>had them on Tuesdays and Thursdays, since on Saturday afternoons they had to</p>
<p>go to a service in the Cathedral. He stopped behind when the rest</p>
<p>of the Sixth went out. May I go to 8lackstable this afternoon, please,</p>
<p>sir? he asked. No, said the headmaster briefly. I wanted to see my</p>
<p>uncle about something very important. Didn t you hear me say no." Philip</p>
<p>did not answer. He went out. He felt almost sick with humiliation, the</p>
<p>humiliation of having to ask and the humiliation of the curt refusal. He</p>
<p>hated the headmaster now, Philip writhed under that despotism which never 162 of</p>
<p>1241 Of Human Bondage vouchsafed a reason for the most tyrannous act. He</p>
<p>was too angry to care what he did, and after dinner walked down</p>
<p>to the station, by the back ways he knew so well, just in</p>
<p>time to catch the train to Blackstable. He walked into the vicarage and</p>
<p>found his uncle and aunt sitting in the dining-room. Hulloa, where have you</p>
<p>sprung from? said the Vicar. It was very clear that he was not</p>
<p>pleased to see him. He looked a little uneasy. I thought I d</p>
<p>come and see you about my leaving. I want to know what you</p>
<p>mean by promising me one thing when I was here, and doing something</p>
<p>different a week after. He was a little frightened at his own boldness,</p>
<p>but he had made up his mind exactly what words to use, and,</p>
<p>though his heart beat violently, he forced himself to say them. Have you</p>
<p>got leave to come here this afternoon? No. I asked Perkins and he</p>
<p>refused. If you like to write and tell him I ve been here</p>
<p>you can get me into a really fine old row. Mrs. Carey sat</p>
<p>knitting with trembling hands. She was unused to scenes and they agitated her</p>
<p>extremely. It would serve you right if I told him, said Mr. Carey.</p>
<p>163 of 1241 Of Human Bondage "if you like to be a perfect</p>
<p>sneak you can. After writing to Perkins as you did you re quite</p>
<p>capable of it. It was foolish of Philip to say that, because it</p>
<p>gave the Vicar exactly the opportunity he wanted. I m not going to</p>
<p>sit still while you say impertinent things to me, he said with dignity.</p>
<p>He got up and walked quickly out of the room into his study.</p>
<p>Philip heard him shut the door and lock it. Oh, I wish to</p>
<p>God I were twenty-one. It is awful to be tied down like this.</p>
<p>Aunt Louisa began to cry quietly. Oh, Philip, you oughtn t to have</p>
<p>spoken to your uncle like that. Do please go and tell him you</p>
<p>re sorry. I m not in the least sorry. He s taking a</p>
<p>mean advantage. Of course it s just waste of money keeping me on</p>
<p>at school, but what does he care? It s not his money. It</p>
<p>was cruel to put me under the guardianship of people who know nothing</p>
<p>about things. Philip. Philip in his voluble anger stopped suddenly at the sound</p>
<p>of her voice. It was heart-broken. He had not realised what bitter things</p>
<p>he was saying. Philip, how can you be so unkind." You know</p>
