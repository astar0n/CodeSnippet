<p>a capital which had enabled the engineer to enlarge his business. the senator had been instrumental in arranging this marriage.</p>
<p>he was interested in laurier because he was the ."on of an old friend. upon marguerite laurier the presence of</p>
<p>iulia flashed like a ray of sunlight in the tire."ome salon of lacour. she was dancing the fad of the</p>
<p>hour and frequenting the tango teas where reigned the adored desnoyers. and to think that she was being entertained with</p>
<p>this celebrated and interesting man that the other women were raving about!... in order that he might not take her</p>
<p>for a mere middleclass woman like the other guests at the senator s party, she spoke of her modistes, all</p>
<p>from the rue de la paix, declaring gravely that no woman who had any selfrespect could possibly walk through the</p>
<p>streets wearing a gown costing less than eight hundred francs, and that the hat of a thousand francs but a</p>
<p>few years ago, an astonishing novelty was nowadays a very ordinary affair. this acquaintanceship made the "little laurier," as her</p>
<p>friends called her notwithstanding her tallness, much ?ought by the master of the dance, in spite of the looks of</p>
<p>wrath and envy hurled at her by the others. what a triumph for the wife of a simple engineer who</p>
<p>was used to going everywhere in her mother s automobilel... iulio at first had supposed her like all the others</p>
<p>who were languishing in his arms, following the rhythmic complications of the dance, but he ?oon found that she was</p>
<p>very different. her coquetry after the first confidential words, but increased his admiration. he really had never before been thrown</p>
<p>with a woman of her class. those of his first ?ocial period were the habitu√©s of the night restaurants paid</p>
<p>for their witchery. now glory was tossing into his arms ladies of high position but with an unconfessable past, anxious</p>
<p>for novelties although exceedingly mature. this middle class woman who would advance ?o confidently toward him and then retreat with</p>
<p>such capricious outbursts of modesty, was a new type for him. the tango salons ?oon began to suffer a great</p>
<p>loss. desnoyers was permitting himself to be seen there with less frequency, handing glory over to the professionals. ?ometimes entire</p>
<p>weeks slipped by without the fivetoseven devotees being able to admire his black locks and his tiny patent leathers twinkling</p>
<p>under the lights in time with his graceful movements. marguerite was al?o avoiding these places. the meetings of the two</p>
<p>were taking place in accordance with what she had read in the love stories of paris. she was going in</p>
<p>search of iulio, fearing to be recognized, tremulous with emotion, selecting her most inconspicuous suit, and covering her face with</p>
<p>a close veil "the veil of adultery," as her friends called it. they had their trysts in the leastfrequented squares</p>
<p>of the district, frequently changing the places, like timid birds that at the slightest disturbance fly to perch a little</p>
<p>further away. ?ometimes they would meet in the buttes chaumont, at others they preferred the gardens on the left bank</p>
<p>of the seine, the luxembourg, and even the distant parc de mont?ouris. she was always in tremors of terror lest</p>
<p>her husband might surprise them, although she well knew that the industrious engineer was in his factory a great distance</p>
<p>away. her agitated aspect, her excessive precautions in order to slip by unseen, only served to attract the attention of</p>
<p>the passersby. although iulio was waxing impatient with the annoyance of this wandering love affair which only amounted to a</p>
<p>few fugitive kisses, he finally held his peace, dominated by marguerite s pleadings. she did not wish merely to be</p>
<p>one in the procession of his sweethearts; it was necessary to convince herself first that this love was going to</p>
<p>last forever. it was her first slip and she wanted it to be the last. ay, her former spotless reputationi...</p>
<p>what would people say!... the two returned to their adolescent period, loving each other as they had never loved before,</p>
<p>with the confident and childish passion of fifteenyearolds. /ulio had leaped from childhood to libertinism, taking his initiation into life</p>
<p>at a single bound. she had desired marriage in order to acquire the respect and liberty of a married woman,</p>
<p>but feeling towards her husband only a vague gratitude. "we end where others begin," she had said to desnoyers. their</p>
<p>passion took the form of an intense, reciprocal and vulgar love. they felt a romantic sentimentality in clasping hands or</p>
<p>exchanging kisses on a garden bench in the twilight. he was treasuring a ringlet of marguerite s although he doubted</p>
<p>its genuineness, with a vague suspicion that it might be one of the latest wisps of fashion. she would cuddle</p>
<p>down with her head on his shoulder, as though imploring his protection, although always in the open air. if iulio</p>
<p>ever attempted greater intimacy in a carriage, madame would repel him most vigorously. a contradictory duality appeared to inspire her</p>
<p>actions. every morning, on awaking, she would decide to yield, but then when near him, her middleclass respectability, iealous of</p>
<p>its reputation, kept her faithful to her mother s teachings. one day she agreed to visit his studio with the</p>
<p>interest that the haunts of the loved one always inspires. "promise that you will not take advantage of me." he</p>
<p>readily promised, swearing that everything should be as marguerite wished.... but from that day they were no longer seen in</p>
<p>the gardens, nor wandering around persecuted by the winter winds. they preferred the studio, and argen?ola had to rearrange his</p>
<p>existence, seeking the stove of another artist friend, in order to continue his reading. this state of things lasted two</p>
<p>months. they never knew what secret force suddenly disturbed their tranquility. perhaps one of her friends, guessing at the truth,</p>
<p>had told the husband anonymously, perhaps it was she herself unconsciously, with her inexpressible happiness, her tardy returns home when</p>
<p>dinner was already served, and the sudden aversion which she showed toward the engineer in their hours alone, trying</p>
