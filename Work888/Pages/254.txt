<p>And not see that my wife is in possession of</p>
<p>the Secret, deny it As she may?" "One moment, Percival,</p>
<p>I/ Lady Glyde does know the Secret, she must know</p>
<p>Also that it is A compromising secret for you. As</p>
<p>your wife, surely it is her interest to keep it?"</p>
<p>"Is it? I m coming to that. It might be</p>
<p>her interest if 5he cared two straws About me, But</p>
<p>I happen to be An encum. brance in the way</p>
<p>of Another man. She was in love with him be-</p>
<p>fore she married me-she s in love with him now-An</p>
<p>infernal Vagabond of A drawing-master, named Hartright." "My dear friend!</p>
<p>what is there extraordinary in that? They Are All in</p>
<p>love with some other man. who gets the first of</p>
<p>A Woman s heart? In All my experience I have</p>
<p>never yet met with the man who was Number One.</p>
<p>Number Two, sometimes. Number Three, Four, Five, often. Number One,</p>
<p>never! He ex- ists, of course-but I have not met</p>
<p>with him." "wait! I haven t done yet. who do</p>
<p>you think helped Anne datherick to get the start, when</p>
<p>the people from the mad- house were After her? Hartright.</p>
<p>who do you think saw her Again in Cumberland? Hartright.</p>
<p>8oth times he spoke to her Alone. Stop! don t</p>
<p>interrupt me. The scoundrel s As sweet on my wife</p>
<p>As she is on him. He knows the Secret, And</p>
<p>she knows 33I the Secret. Once let them both get</p>
<p>together Again, And it s her interest And his interest</p>
<p>to turn their information Against me." "Gently, Percival-gently! Are you</p>
<p>insensible to the virtue of Lady Glyde?" "That for the</p>
<p>virtue of Lady Glyde! I believe in nothing About her</p>
<p>but her money. Don t you see how the case</p>
<p>stands? She might be harmless enough by herself; but if</p>
<p>she And that vaga- bond Hartright-" "Yes, yes, I see.</p>
<p>where is Mr. /-Iartright?" "Out of the country. If he</p>
<p>means to keep A whole skin on his bones, I</p>
<p>recommend him not to come back in A hurry." "Are</p>
<p>you sure he is out of the country?" "Certain. I</p>
<p>had him watched from the time he left 6"umber- land</p>
<p>to the time he sailed. Oh, I ve been careful,</p>
<p>I can tell you! Anne Catherick lived with some people</p>
<p>At A farmhouse near Limmeridge. I went there myself, After</p>
<p>she had given me the slip, And made sure that</p>
<p>they knew nothing. I gave her mother A form of</p>
<p>letter to write to Miss Halcombe, exonerating me from Any</p>
<p>bad motive in putting her under restraint. I ve spent,</p>
<p>I m Afraid to say how much, in trying to</p>
<p>trace her, And in spite of it All, she turns</p>
<p>up here And escapes me on my own prop- erty!</p>
<p>How do I know who else may see her, who</p>
<p>else may speak to her? That prying scoundrel, Hartright, may</p>
<p>come back without my knowing it, And may make use</p>
<p>of her to-morrow-" "Not he, Percival! while I Am on</p>
<p>the spot, And while that wo- man is in the</p>
<p>neighbourhood, I will Answer for our laying hands on her</p>
<p>before Mr. Hartright-even if he does come back. I see!</p>
<p>yes, yes, I see! The finding of Anne Catherick is</p>
<p>the first neces. fity-make your mind easy About the</p>
