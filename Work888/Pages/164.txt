<p>air force bus. the squealing protest of a combination of dry, unlubricated steel and rust brought his attention back to</p>
<p>the bus as its passenger door swung open. brad turned in time to see a set of bare legs flash</p>
<p>beneath a mid-calf length white skirt when she stepped off the bus. the skirt had a narrow dark blue ribbon</p>
<p>sewed around the hem and was so heavily starched he was sure it would break when it bumped against the</p>
<p>door of the bus. by american standards they were short legs, but they were beautiful. each well developed muscle was</p>
<p>firm and clearly defined to create two shapely meaterpieces. on her small feet the girl wore flat-heeled slippers made of</p>
<p>a soft black leather. as if he had x-ray vision a bit of silken thigh flashed through brad s imagination</p>
<p>when the petite doll-girl stepped down onto the sidewalk. she hesitated for a sliver of time before starting along the</p>
<p>sidewalk toward him. brad burgess wasn t very tall, about 5 I" in stocking feet weighing in at a hard</p>
<p>126 pounds, but as the girl approached he began to realize just how big he was on the island of</p>
<p>okinawa. he studied her as she drew nearer. the girl wasn t quite five feet tall and weighed less than</p>
<p>ninety pounds. those ninety pounds were beautifully arranged. her breasts weren t large, but under the tight fitting bodice of</p>
<p>her starched dress they were perfectly symmetrical and in absolute proportion to the rest of her compact body. involuntarily he</p>
<p>found himself looking up into the most beautiful almond shaped, dark brown eyes he had ever seen. outlined with shiny</p>
<p>black, thick lashes and eyebrows, her eyes grabbed and captured brad in their depths. he watched in admiration when she</p>
<p>walked through the glass doors and across the terminal floor. the white skirt stretched tightly across her beautifully formed backside</p>
<p>and emphasized her gracefully feminine walk. "oh, my god, i m in love." brad heard himself say. "hey." you the</p>
<p>seabee going to naha?" he felt the heat of embarrassment flash across his cheeks and knew his ears were glowing</p>
<p>red when he heard the sound of a deep female voice speaking american. he was so engrossed in the girl</p>
<p>that brad hadn t heard the ugly gray, navy six pac pull up to the curb in front of the</p>
<p>air force bus. the driver was hollering through his open window, and brad was certain he had heard his vocal</p>
<p>declaration of love for the beautiful girl. "yeah, i am. where in hell have you been?" "sleeping, man. i ve</p>
<p>had the duty for the last two nights." the driver spoke slowly and matter-of-factly. brad couldn t hear even a</p>
<p>hint of aggression in the driver s voice when he stepped up to the side of the six pac. through</p>
<p>the open window he could see that the driver was dressed in tailor made, but very wrinkled, dungarees. not only</p>
<p>had the dungarees and short sleeved chambray shirt been worked in, they looked as if they had been slept in.</p>
<p>his light brown hair hung down over his forehead partially obscuring his flattened fighter s nose and flashing green eyes.</p>
<p>and he needed a haircut. the driver and brad both turned towards the high pitched voice. she was walking very</p>
<p>fast, almost trotting towards them from the air force bus. dressed in the same uniform as the first petite girl,</p>
<p>but she was most decidedly not petite. she was tall and square. at least two inches taller than brad and</p>
<p>twenty pounds heavier, but the graceful motion of hands and hips were there. her round face had small pock marks</p>
<p>which ruined the image of her soft flawless asian complexion, but they in no way distracted from her beauty. her</p>
<p>eyes, which brad would learn, were pure okinawan not iapanese. they had no hint of an eyelid fold, and were</p>
<p>large, round and a beautiful, soft brown. where have you been, you big beautiful woman?" the driver hollered back while</p>
<p>he was hurriedly exiting the 6 pac. "i quit the clover and leave noumanoui for good. that place got to</p>
<p>be number ten for me. you won t shack-up with me, larry, then merchant man give me the clap for</p>
<p>five dollar. cheap bastard not want to pay for all night. he say he stay with me all week, until</p>
<p>his ship leave. then after he get me one time he go back to the bar. he never come back,"</p>
<p>"i m sorry, kaiko, but i told you not to go with merchant sailors. they re nothing but trouble. "i</p>
<p>go to work in snack bar now larry. you come see me? come home with me, okay? you number one</p>
<p>for me larry, come my home, pease." "where are you living, kaiko? kadena?" "no way, i have big house in</p>
<p>old koza. no gis come anymore so mama-san let me have big house real cheap. "okay. what time you get</p>
<p>off work friday night? i won t have the duty this weekend so i ll stay all weekend with you."</p>
<p>"sixteen hundred, larry-san. you meet me on bc street?" "yeah, but not before nineteen hundred. i ll meet you in</p>
<p>the goya restaurant and buy you some gohon." brad watched and listened to the exchange between these two very ethnically</p>
<p>different people in amazement. neither were fluent in the other s language, but nonetheless they communicated and got their wants</p>
<p>known to the other. "what?" brad was still lost in his own thoughts and it took him a second or</p>
<p>two to realize that the seabee was talking to him. "the nesan, girl to you. i love every one of</p>
<p>them. larry perkins, i m a builder." the seabee driver proclaimed as he stuck out a work calloused hand. "you</p>
<p>re a driver, huh? what mob you out of?" perkins rambled on not allowing brad to answer as they shook</p>
<p>hands, "i came from mcb 11. there s three or four of us at naha from 1I, "come on,</p>
