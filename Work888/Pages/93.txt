<p>one who rode on that raid was guiltless of the Squaw creek murders. arlie came in presently, and sat down</p>
<p>near the window with some embroidery. "did the boys tire you?" she asked, noting his unusual silence. "no. i was</p>
<p>thinking about what they told me. they Were giving me the inside facts of the squaw creek raid." she looked</p>
<p>up in surprise. "they were?" a little smile began to dimple the corners of her mouth. "that s funny, because</p>
<p>they had just got through forgiving me for what i told you." "what they told me was how the shooting</p>
<p>occurred." "i don t know anything about that. when i told you their names i was only telling what i</p>
<p>had heard people whisper. that s all i knew." "you ve been troubled because your friends were in this, haven</p>
<p>t you? you hated to think it of them, didn t you?" he asked. "yes. it has troubled me a</p>
<p>lot." "don t let it trouble you any more. one man was responsible for all the bloodshed. he went mad</p>
<p>and saw red for half a minute. before the rest could stop him, the slaughter was done. the other boys</p>
<p>aren t guilty of that, any more than you or i." "oh, i m glad-- i m glad," she cried</p>
<p>softly. then, looking up quickly to him: "who Was the man?" she asked. "i don t know. it is better</p>
<p>that neither of us should know that." "i m glad the boys told you. it shows they trust you." "they</p>
<p>figure me out a white man," he answered carelessly. "ah! that s where i made my mistake." she looked at</p>
<p>him bravely, though the color began to beat into her cheeks beneath the dusky tan. "yet i knew it all</p>
<p>the time-- in my heart. at least, after i had given myself time to think it over, i knew you</p>
<p>couldn t be that. if i had given you time to explain" but i always think too late." his eyes,</p>
<p>usually so clear and steely, softened at her words. "i m satisfied if you knew" in your heart." "i meant----"</p>
<p>she began, with a flush. "now, don t spoil it, please," he begged, under his steady, half-smiling gaze, her eyes</p>
<p>fell. two weeks ago she had been a splendid young greature, as untaught of life as one of the wild</p>
<p>forest animals and as unconsciously eager for it. but there had come a change over her, a birth of womanhood</p>
<p>from that night when she had stood between stephen fraser and death. no doubt she would often regret it, but</p>
<p>she had begun to live more deeply. she could never go back to the care-free days when she could look</p>
<p>all men in the face with candid, girlish eyes. the time had come to her, as it must to all</p>
<p>sensitive of life, when she must drink of it, whether she would or no. "because i d rather you would</p>
<p>know it in your heart than in your mind," he said. something sweet and terrifying, with the tingle and warmth</p>
<p>of rare wine in it, began to glow in her veins. eyes shy, eager, frightened, met his for an instant.</p>
<p>then she remembered the other girl. something hard as steel ran through her. she turned on her heel and left</p>
<p>the room. from that day fraser had a new nurse. arlie disappeared, and her aunt replaced her a few hours</p>
<p>later and took charge of the patient. steve took her desertion as an irritable convalescent does, but he did not</p>
<p>let his disappointment make him unpleasant to miss ruth dillon. "i m a chump," he told himself, with deep disgust.</p>
<p>"hadn t any more sense than to go scaring off the little girl by handing out a line of talk</p>
<p>she ain t used to. i reckon now she s done with me proper." he continued to improve so rapidly</p>
<p>that within the prescribed two weeks he was on horseback again, though still a little weak and washed out. his</p>
<p>first ride of any length was to the dillon ranch. siegfried accompanied him, and across the norwegian s saddle lay</p>
<p>a very business-like rifle. as they were passing the mouth of a ca?on, the ranger put a casual question: "this</p>
<p>jack rabbit run, sig?" "yah. more men wanted bane lost in that gulch than any place ay knows of." "that</p>
<p>so? i m going in there to-morrow to find that man struve," his friend announced carelessly. the big blonde giant</p>
<p>looked at him. "yuh bain t, steve? why, yuh bain t fit to tackle a den uh wild cats." an</p>
<p>admiring grin lit the norwegian s face. "durn my hide, yuh ve got em all skinned for grit, steve. uh</p>
<p>course, ay bane goin with yuh," "if it won t get you in bad with your friends i ll be</p>
<p>glad to have you, sig." "they bain t my friends. ay bane shook them, an served notice to that effect."</p>
<p>"glad of it." "yuh bane goin in after struve only?" "yes. he s the only man i want." "then ay</p>
<p>bane go in, and bring heem out to yuh." fraser shook his head. "no, old man, i ve got to</p>
<p>play my own hand." "ay t ink it be a lot safer f r me to happen in an get</p>
<p>heem," remonstrated siegfried. "safer for me," corrected the lieutenant, smiling. "no, i can t work that way. i ve got</p>
<p>to fat?! my own chances. you can go along, though, on one condition. you re not to interfere between me</p>
<p>and struve. if some one else butts in, you may ask him why, if you like. "ay bane t ink</p>
<p>yuh von fool, steve. but ay bane no boss. vat yuh says goes." they found arlie watering geraniums in front</p>
<p>of the house. siegfried merely nodded to her and passed on to the stables with the horses. fraser dismounted, offering</p>
<p>her his hand and his warm smile. he had caught her without warning, and she was a little shy</p>
