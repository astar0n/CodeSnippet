<p>marched down to breakfast. unsurprisingly, noxious black and his army of slytherin friends were waiting at the mighty entrance to</p>
<p>the great hall. ah, dumbledore, noxious said. we have been waiting for you. get out of our way, william said</p>
<p>irritably. we do not want to have to duel with you. albus cringed. he thought that william might have just</p>
<p>blown their cover over the fact that they knew the secret plan. but noxious did not blink or act in</p>
<p>any way to suggest that he was surprisingd by william s comment. instead, his eyes locked on albus . dumbledore,</p>
<p>do not let the potter idiot speak for you, noxious said. do you remember our little ten galleon bet that</p>
<p>davey /ones would lose to me in a duel at the end of the year? yes, i do, albus said</p>
<p>loudly. he now wished that he had not been so bold on his first night at hogwarts. he made a</p>
<p>silent promise to himself never to make foolish bets like that again. well, i want to have it this weekend,</p>
<p>noxious said, smirking and crossing his arms. albus s brain worked quickly. he knew that this had something to do</p>
<p>with forcing albus into a crook and into a duel with the slytherins. unfortunately, he had made a fair bet</p>
<p>with noxious and the consequences of backing out would be the trashing of his reputation among all the first years</p>
<p>at hogwarts. even expulsion was better than that. the terms of our agreement, as everyone will remind you, albus said</p>
<p>calmly, are that the duel occurs at the end of first year. so, davey [ones will duel with you on</p>
<p>the last day of exams. albus pushed through the protective guard of his friends, past the slytherins and into the</p>
<p>great hall. his friends hurriedly caught up, breathing heavily. well, i think we should be alright until then, albus said.</p>
<p>we will still avoid the slytherins at every cost, but i think their plan is to duel me after noxious</p>
<p>has duelled davey, i think he is convinced that he will beat davey. he will if he knows the cardia</p>
<p>mortis spell, mars pointed out. by merlin! cried albus, realising what this meant, i am going to have to spend</p>
<p>every spare minute before exams figuring out how to protect myself and davey against it! if albus thought he had</p>
<p>enough to worry about, the first lesson of the day proved him immediately wrong. the gryffindors had defence against the</p>
<p>dark arts with the slytherins and professor fudge. the dog-faced slytherin housemaster marched to the front of the class, ordered</p>
<p>everyone to sit down, and directed his eyes until they met albus . dumbledore, will you kindly summon that phoenix</p>
<p>of yours? professor fudge said in an unnaturally soft, pleasant voice. i  i do not own one, albus said,</p>
<p>feeling hot under the collar. you most certainly do, professor fudge snapped. ten points from gryffindor for lying to me.</p>
<p>i have enough witnesses to prove that you do. now summon the phoenix. i need it for today s very</p>
<p>special lesson. you would not want the rest of the class to miss out because you were being selfish, would</p>
<p>you? the slytherins pointed fake looks of disgust in albus direction. the gryffindors knew better than to react, professor, the</p>
<p>phoenix does not belong to me anymore, albus said, not blinking at the bulldog face staring at him, forty points</p>
<p>from gryffindor for continuing to lie to me! yelled professor fudge. he marched down the aisle between the desks and</p>
<p>pointed a fat finger at albus chest. albus had to fight the urge to splutter when he was hit by</p>
<p>a wave of professor fudge s bad breath. you will summon that phoenix and you will summon it now! albus</p>
<p>leaped to his feet, glaring at professor fudge. he felt like pulling out his wand and hexing the horrible old</p>
<p>man. alright then, i will show you that i do not own it anymore, albus said. he started screaming, not</p>
<p>tearing his eyes from professor fudges , fawkes! fawkes! come here! i need you! i am in lots of danger!</p>
<p>fawkes, if you do not come i am going to lose more points for gryffindor! no, i am going to</p>
<p>die." fawkes! fawkes! fortunately, the phoenix did not appear in the room, just as albus had predicted. the phoenix was</p>
<p>far too smart for that. albus let a gleam of triumph cross his eyes, professor fudge saw it, and his</p>
<p>look grew even fouler. fifty more points from gryffindor, professor fudge yelled. get out of this class, gryffindors, i will</p>
<p>not teach any of you again. not ever. as the gryffindors made their glad exit from the room, william was</p>
<p>heard to mutter under his breath, let us hope so. that night in the gryffindor Common room, albus got something</p>
<p>that offered him even more relief." more than knowing that fawkes was safe in the forbidden forest, more than knowing</p>
<p>that a potential duel with the slytherins was delayed until the end of exams in a few months, and more</p>
<p>than knowing that the gryffindors never ever had to have defence against the dark arts with professor fudge again: albus</p>
<p>got a letter back from archaeon. to my dearest son albus, i, too, have heard through the grapevine that all</p>
<p>is not as it should be at hogwarts and elsewhere. therefore, rest assured that i am doing everything in my</p>
<p>power to offset the plans of those who have designs on that which does not belong to them. my advice</p>
<p>to you is this: do whatever it takes to avoid being expelled. i am certain that you are capable of</p>
<p>working out what that will entail. you are well protected at hogwarts, so do not fear anything or anyone. all</p>
<p>my love, archaeon albus breathed a sigh of immense relief as he handed the letter to the ohure pirates to</p>
<p>read. all the fears that had built up over the past months seemed to leave him with that letter.</p>
