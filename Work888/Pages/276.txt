<p>me. it smelled good but i wasn t hungry. he closed the curtains and left the room immediately without looking</p>
<p>at me again. i so badly wanted to ask what he wanted from me, but i was anohure hour dragged</p>
<p>past and bridget or rather angela, opened the door. she had a gun in her hand and pointed it at</p>
<p>me as she walked closer. this girl seemed capable of murder, and i was terrified. my heart raced and my</p>
<p>palms were sweating. this is it, i thought. this is the end of you, valerie. i closed my eyes and</p>
<p>but she didn t pull the trigger. instead, she roughly yanked me out of bed with the gun held to</p>
<p>my head. "don t try anything. i swear i will shoot you and leave you here to die, you hear</p>
<p>me?" she i nodded, relieved to be alive. she took me to the loo. survival mode kicked in and i</p>
<p>took in as much as possible of everything that i saw around me, but there wasn t much to see,</p>
<p>the hallway was extremely short and all the doors were closed. the loo was the first door to the left;</p>
<p>there was one ohure door to the right and one straight ahead. she pushed me through the door and waited</p>
<p>in the entrance for me, turned sideways. it was a small bathroom, with only a shower, a toilet and a</p>
<p>single basin. there weren t any windows, only an extraction fan. at least it was clean and i appreciated the</p>
<p>visit; it was high time. it took a while to calm down and for the feeling of the gun against</p>
<p>my head to go away after she had left. but then i thought about beniamin again, and alex. maybe it</p>
<p>was a good thing that i had been captured and possibly on my way to the butcher. at least everybody</p>
<p>else would be safe from now on. beniamin had died because of me, because i had broken my promise to</p>
<p>him and betrayed him. and to think that he still came after me to protect me. he had risked his</p>
<p>life for me. and he had lost it because of me. and alex. duncan probably had alex imprisoned somewhere and</p>
<p>was most likely going to kill him. after all, alex s connection was with the sun. a part of me</p>
<p>felt incredibly impressed, about alex and the sun. it felt right, it fitted him perfectly. he was that kind of</p>
<p>person. to me, the sun meant warmth and life and power and steadiness, and that was alex. that absolutely was</p>
<p>alex! i was proud at the thought of alex being the sun. a spark of hope ignited in my insides.</p>
<p>maybe alex was strong enough, with the sun s power at his service, to win duncan over. or /"ust to</p>
<p>get away. but then i remembered that alex was in a coma. he wouldn t be able to defend himself.</p>
<p>i didn t want alex to die. and i didn t want benaimin to have died. alex had been so</p>
<p>kind to me, so patient. he obviously knew exactly what was going on with me, how i struggled. i thought</p>
<p>about our first meeting, how he tried to warn me against the parking, a complete stranger warning a first year,</p>
<p>and how he had unloaded my car. then i thought about the party, about him being so popular, and how</p>
<p>he d played the guitar so well that he had the room under a spell. he was such an unbelievable</p>
<p>person, so talented and intelligent and popular and beautiful and... and... and everything that i had ever wanted in a</p>
<p>guy. he truly was the essence of the sun. if only i could hear him speak once more, to see</p>
<p>if he was fine. or see him play that guitar again. it struck me that alex mattered to me. a</p>
<p>lot. i let the thought float a little in my mind, like a soap bubble in the bath. i liked</p>
<p>alex. there, it was out, i had finally admitted it to myself. i liked alex a lot, too much actually.</p>
<p>i was in too far. so i firmly put the thought out of my mind. i had vowed more than</p>
<p>once to leave alex alone. and even if by some miracle things happened to go back to normal, i wouldn</p>
<p>t go near him. no, i had already betrayed lisa once, i would never do it again. but even that</p>
<p>miracle was impossible. alex was going to die as well, if duncan hadn t managed to kill him already, the</p>
<p>thought was too much for me; it felt as if the sorrow was too big for my body. i cried</p>
<p>as if the world was ending. how i hated myself. i couldn t believe what i had done to everyone.</p>
<p>the worst part was the remorse. i literally spent hours and hours hating myself for what i had done," crying</p>
<p>didn t help at all. after a while the tears dried up. i deserved to die. i didn t care</p>
<p>about angela and her gun any more. i wouldn t be scared next time she came. i fell asleep for</p>
<p>the first time around fIur in the morning. it became the pattern: duncan came in once a day with a</p>
<p>tray of food and a glass of water. angela came in three times a day and took me to the</p>
<p>loo at gunpoint. by the end of the third day, there wasn t any emotion left, only an infinitely big</p>
<p>nothingness. on the morning of the fourth day, i felt much worse than before, physically and emotionally. the pain in</p>
<p>my leg was killing me and my ankles were throbbing from the restraints they had put on me: my sugar</p>
<p>was obviously low and my hands were trembling. and i had a headache, probably because i was dehydrated. duncan came</p>
<p>in during the late morning, around ten. i was hopeful for an extra glass of water when he entered.</p>
