<p>o all gods and all ye goddesses." and see the justice of zeys. for these cringing immortals {from what part</p>
<p>of the heavens they come, i know not}, having taken shapes similar to ours on some false pretences, audacious ones,</p>
<p>have not been content with the worship of their romans, but, bursting with arrogance, they have presumed to claim also</p>
<p>the worship of the rolling-eyed argives. long, indeed, have i been patient with them, with fair words and deeds: but</p>
<p>they have ventured to bring war to lofty olympos. witless that they are, to be wrath in their folly against</p>
<p>zeys, who (sitting all by himself) careth not, nor taketh any thought about them: for i deem that i, among</p>
<p>immortal gods, am manifestly pre-eminent in power and might etcetera. wherefore, let them content themselves with whatsoever sorrows i shall</p>
<p>send on each one of them." but fierce impetuous ares stood high in his war-chariot, whereto were yoked his horses</p>
<p>fear and dread; and he slapped his strong thighs with his hands flatwise, saying: "o lord of the lightning and</p>
<p>the dark cloud, smite them with the thunderbolts; and let them lie among the dead in dust and blood." but,</p>
<p>when they heard this awful word, the latin gods leaped up to touch the beard and the knees of zeys,</p>
<p>crying aloud in a panic-terror as they bobbed up and down, saying: "we supplicate thee by thy beard, and by</p>
<p>thy knees, and by thy parents, to take good store of gold and korinthic bronze (which is platinum and better</p>
<p>than gold) as a ransom, and to let us go in peace." but, unto them, the father and king of</p>
<p>gods and men, with grimmer gaze, responded, saying: "dogs, dogs, supplicate me not by beard or knees or parents: for</p>
<p>neither a tenfold nor a twentyfold ransom can make amends for rebellion. nevertheless, seeing that ye be immortal, even as</p>
<p>are also we others, white death may not come anigh you. but let us hear much-contriving odysseys, the peer of</p>
<p>zeys in counsel: for perchance he hath some apt unwinged sentence of judgment in his wily mind." then, indeed, i</p>
<p>stood up before all the blooming company of heaven, in my silver-shining chariot inlaid with crabs and moons in mother-of-pearl,</p>
<p>but love was my charioteer; and thus i sald: "immortality to immortals, and nothings to nothingness." and all the gods</p>
<p>and goddesses (bestowers of good things) stood in their own war-chariots; and inextinguishable laughter arose among the blessed gods, when</p>
<p>they heard my wily words. but great zeys sald: "it pleaseth us," and, so, of our own free will, we</p>
<p>command that it shall be done." and, immediately, all the gods and goddesses of olympos leaped upon all the blameless</p>
<p>gods and goddesses of rome, zeys upon iuppiter, and hera upon iuno, helios hyperion upon sol, and selene upon luna,</p>
<p>phoibos apollon upon apollo, and artemis upon diana, ares upon mars, and iakkhos dionysos upon bacchus, eros upon cupid, and</p>
<p>aphrodite upon venus, hermes upon mercury, and pallas athene upon minerva, demeter upon ceres, and hephaistos upon vulcan, hades upon</p>
<p>pluto, and persephone upon proserpina, kastor and polydeykes upon castor and pollux, herakles upon hercules, and poseidon upon neptune, and</p>
<p>innumerable others upon others innumerable, pouncing upon them, like falcons biting the bloody brains of baser birds, buzzards, and such,</p>
<p>sucking out their immortality. and the forms of the latin gods, like flies in the webs of assiduous spiders, lifeless,</p>
<p>and very void, fell back, dropping from heaven to earth; and the speed of their falling ground them to powder,</p>
<p>so that they became as red dust, and a most awful portent for their romans on whom they fell. for,</p>
<p>by chance, at this same time, the romans were perturbed by a political crisis, connected with that gaius iulius caesar,</p>
<p>a king of men and a shepherd of the people. for, when they saw fierce fiery warriors fighting on the</p>
<p>clouds, in ranks and squadrons and right forms of war, which drizzled blood of heroes on the capitol, and, when</p>
<p>they heard the neighing of horses and the groans of ghosts of heroes, slain, shrieking, squealing, going to the land</p>
<p>of shades, then, indeed, blind madness entered into them; and they slew their precious caesar. thus, the heavens themselves blaze</p>
<p>forth the death of princes. but the immortal gods, more amply immortal than ever (if that were possible}, returned to</p>
<p>their dear motherland bearing the spoils of victory; and the divine ones inhabiting olympian palaces began to receive the worship</p>
<p>of the romans, as was due. in this manner, was there peace in the wide-rolling heavens. but king zeys lavished</p>
<p>rich rewards, dividing the roman territories among gods and heroes, giving temples to some and altars to others, to say</p>
<p>nothing of blank walls eligible for immortal effigies. but, because i was by no means anxious to have assigned to</p>
<p>me the worship of mortal men (for, having been myself a man more than once, i know something about the</p>
<p>value of men s worship; and i care as little for suitors who adulate as for enemies who feel bound</p>
<p>to propitiate), then, the father and king of gods and men deigned to give me a wish, confirming the same</p>
<p>with his nod, which is the surest pledge among the immortals. and i sald that i would treasure this wish</p>
<p>in my heart, so that i might use it on occasion: for i desired, at that moment, nothing more than</p>
<p>to live in peace and love with golden helen. and that, i did. living in peace and love, thus, we</p>
<p>entertained ourselves with hunting bears, dragons, and urchins, on the long slopes of lofty olympos, or with delicate banquets in</p>
<p>the halls of various gods. i, also, went frequently to and fro among mortal men, generally invisibly, amusing myself with</p>
<p>their affairs. also, i was wont to disport myself in my well-benched galley, a wonder to be seen, being drawn</p>
<p>by love over the grey-green sea at my will. for hermes my grandsire, and bravely steadfast herakles, and my</p>
