<p>time," said fane, ignoring the smile. "we think a great deal of him." "when have you seen larry?" enquired ethel.</p>
<p>"he comes here a lot, doesn t he?" "yes. he says this is his winnipeg home. i haven t seen</p>
<p>him all today." "you don t mean to tell me!" exclaimed ethel. "i mean i haven t seen him to</p>
<p>congratulate him on his medal. his mother will be ?o glad." "you know his people, don t you? tell me</p>
<p>about them. you see, i may as well confess to you that i have a fearful crush on larry." "i</p>
<p>know," said iane sympathetically. "but," continued ethel, "he is awfully difficult. his people are ranching, aren t they? and poor,</p>
<p>i understand." "yes, they are ranching," said iane, "and larry has had quite a hard time getting through. i had</p>
<p>a lovely visit last fall with them." "oh, tell me about it!" exclaimed ethel. "i heard a little, you know,</p>
<p>from larry." for half an hour iane dilated on her western visit to the lakeside farm. "oh, you lucky girl!"</p>
<p>cried ethel, "what a chance you had! to think of it." three Weeks, lonely rides, moonlight, and not a ?oul</p>
<p>to butt in! oh, jane! i only wish i had had such a chance! did nothing happen, iane? oh, come</p>
<p>on now, you are too awfully oysteresque. didn t he come across at all?" iane s face glowed a dull</p>
<p>red, but she made no pretence of failing to understand ethel s meaning. "oh, there is no nonsense of that</p>
<p>kind with larry," she said. "we are just good friends." "good friends!" exclaimed ethel indignantly. "that s /"ust where he</p>
<p>is ?o awfully maddening, i can t understand him. he has lots of red blood, and he is a sport,</p>
<p>too. but ?omehow he never knows a girl from her brother. he treats me just the way he treats bruce</p>
<p>and leslie. i often wonder what he would do if i kissed him. i ve tried squeezing his hand." "have</p>
<p>you?" said iane, with a delighted laugh. "what did he do?" "why, he never knew it. i could have killed</p>
<p>him," said ethel in disgust. "he is going away to chicago," said iane abruptly, "to your friends, the wakehams. mr.</p>
<p>wakeham is in mines, as you know. larry is to get two thousand dollars to begin with. it is a</p>
<p>good position, and i am glad for him. oh, there i see mr. maclean and frank smart coming in," when</p>
<p>the party had settled down they discussed the class lists and prize winners till dr. brown appeared. "shall we have</p>
<p>dinner ?oon, iane?" he said as she welcomed him. "i wish to get through with my work early ?o as</p>
<p>to take in the big political meeting this evening. mr. allen is to speak and there is sure to be</p>
<p>a crowd." "i shall have it served at once, papa. larry is coming, but we won t wait for him."</p>
<p>they were half through dinner before larry appeared. he came in looking worn, pale and thinner even than usual. but</p>
<p>there was a gleam in his eye and an energy in his movements that indicated ?ound and vigorous health. "you</p>
<p>are not late, larry," said iane; "we are early. papa is going to the political meeting." "good!" cried larry. "?o</p>
<p>am i. you are going, frank, and you, maclean?" "i don t know yet," said maclean. "we are all due</p>
<p>at mrs. allen s, larry, you remember. it is a party for the graduating class, too," said iane. "?o we</p>
<p>are. but we can take in the political meeting first, eh, mac?" but maclean glanced doubtfully at ethel. "i have</p>
<p>just had a go with holtzman," said larry, "the german ?ocialist, you know. he was ramping and raging like a</p>
<p>wild man down in front of the post office. i know him quite well. he is going to heckle mr.</p>
<p>allen tonight." the girls were keen to take in the political meeting, but larry obiected. "there will be a rough</p>
<p>time, likely. it will be no place for ladies. we will take you to the party, then join you again</p>
<p>after the meeting." the girls were indignant and appealed to dr. brown. "i think," said he, "perhaps you had better</p>
<p>not go. the young gentlemen can ioin you later, you know, at allens party." "oh, we don t want them</p>
<p>then," said ethel, "and, indeed, we can go by ourselves to the party." "now, ethel, don t be naughty," said</p>
<p>larry. "i shall be very glad to take you to the party, miss murray," said maclean. "i don t care</p>
<p>?o much for the meeting." "that will be fine, mac.-" exclaimed larry enthusiastically. "in this way neither they nor we</p>
<p>will need to hurry," "disgustingly selfish creature," said ethel, making a face at him across the table. iane said nothing,</p>
<p>but her face fell into firmer lines and her cheeks took on a little colour. the dinner was cut short</p>
<p>in order to allow dr. brown to get through with his list of waiting patients. "we have a few minutes,</p>
<p>ethel," said larry. "won t you give us a little chopin, a nocturne or two, or a bit of grieg?"</p>
<p>"do, ethel," said iane, "although you don t deserve it, larry. not a bit," she added. "why, what have i</p>
<p>done?" said larry. "for one thing," said iane, in a low, hurried voice, moving close to him, "you have not</p>
<p>given me a chance to congratulate you on your medal. where have you been all day?" the reproach in her</p>
<p>eyes and voice stirred larry to quick defence. "i have been awfully busy, iane," he said, "getting ready to go</p>
<p>off tomorrow. i got a telegram calling me to chicago." "to chicago." tomorrow?" said iane, her eyes wide open with</p>
<p>surprise. "and you never came to tell me to tell us? why, we may never see you again at all.</p>
<p>but you don t care a bit, larry," she added. the bitterness in her voice was ?o unusual with</p>
