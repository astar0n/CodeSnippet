<p>was so much to look at and so many boats to wave to, it wasn t till they had actually</p>
<p>got to the statue of liberty that anna-rose remembered her £I0 and the dollars. the young man was saying how</p>
<p>much the statue of liberty had cost, and the word dollars made anna-rose turn with a iump to mr. twist.</p>
<p>"oh_" ghe exclaimed, clutching at her chamois leather bag where it very visibly bulged out beneath her waistband, "i forgot-i</p>
<p>must get change. and how much do you think we ought to tip the stewardess? i ve never tipped anybody</p>
<p>yet ever, and i wish-i wish i hadn t to." she got quite red. it seemed to her dreadful to</p>
<p>offer money to someone so much older than herself and who till almost that very morning had treated her and</p>
<p>anna-felicitas like the naughtiest of tiresome children. surely she would be most offended at being tipped by people such years</p>
<p>younger than herself? mr. twist thought not. "a dollar," said the young man. "one dollar. that s the figure. not</p>
<p>a cent more, or you girls ll get inflating prices and wall street ll bust up." anna-rose, not heeding him</p>
<p>and clutching nervously the place where her bag was, told mr. twist that the stewardess hadn t seemed to mind</p>
<p>them quite so much last night, and still less that morning, and perhaps some little memento-something that wasn t money-</p>
<p>"give her those caps of yours," said the young man, bursting into hilarity," but indeed it wasn t his fault</p>
<p>that he was a low young man. mr. twist, shutting him out of the conversation by interposing a shoulder, told</p>
<p>anna-rose he had noticed stewardesses, and also stewards, softened when iourneys drew near their end, but that it didn t</p>
<p>mean they wanted mementos. they wanted money; and he would do the tipping for her if she liked. anna-rose lumped</p>
<p>at it. this tipping of the stewardess had haunted her at intervals throughout the iourney whenever she woke up at</p>
<p>night. she felt that, not having yet in her life tipped anybody, it was very hard that she couldn t</p>
<p>begin with somebody more her own size. "then if you don t mind coming behind the funnel," she said, "i</p>
<p>can give you my £5 notes, and perhaps you would get them changed for me and deduct what you think</p>
<p>the stewardess ought to have." mr. twist, and also anna-felicitas, who wasn t allowed to stay behind with the exuberant</p>
<p>young man though she was quite unconscious of his presence, went with anna-rose behind the funnel, where after a great</p>
<p>deal of private fumbling, her back turned to them, she produced the two much-crumpled £5 notes. "the steward ought to</p>
<p>have something too," said mr. twist. "oh, i d be glad if you d do him as well," said anna-rose</p>
<p>eagerly. "i don t think i could offer him a tip. he has been so fatherly to us. and imagine</p>
<p>offering to tip one s father." mr. twist laughed, and said she would get over this feeling in time, he</p>
<p>promised to do what was right, and to make it clear that the tips he bestowed were twinkler tips; and</p>
<p>presently he came back with messages of thanks from the tipped-such polite ones from the stewardess that the twins were</p>
<p>astonished-and gave anna-rose a packet of very dirty-looking slices of green paper, which were dollar bills, he said, besides a</p>
<p>variety of strange coins which he spread out on a ledge and explained to her. "the exchange was favourable to</p>
<p>you to-day," said mr. twist, counting out the money. "how nice of it," said anna-rose politely. "did you keep your</p>
<p>eye on its variations?" she added a little loudly, with a view to rousing respect in anna-felicitas who was lounging</p>
<p>against a seat and showing a total absence of every kind of appropriate emotion. "certainly," said mr. twist after a</p>
<p>slight pause. "i kept both my eyes on all of them." mr. twist had, it appeared, presented the steward and</p>
<p>stewardess each with a dollar on behalf of the misses twinkler, but because the exchange was so favourable this had</p>
<p>made no difference to the £5 notes. reducing each £5 note into german marks, which was the way the twinklers,</p>
<p>in spite of :1 Via" in england, still dealt in their heads with money before they could get a clear</p>
<p>idea of it, there would have been two hundred marks." and as it took, roughly, four marks to make a</p>
<p>dollar, the two hundred marks would have to be divided by four; which, leaving aside that extra complication of variations</p>
<p>in the exchange, and regarding the exchange for a moment and for purposes of simplification as keeping quiet for a</p>
<p>bit and resting, should produce, also roughly, said anna-rose a little out of breath as she got to the end</p>
<p>of her calculation, fifty dollars. "correct," said mr. twist, who had listened with respectful attention. "here they are." "i said</p>
<p>roughly," said anna-rose. "it can t be exactly fifty dollars. the tips anyhow would alter that." "yes, but you forget</p>
<p>the exchange." anna-rose was silent. she didn t want to go into that before anna-felicitas. of the two, she was</p>
<p>supposed to be the least bad at sums, their mother had put it that Way, refusing to say, as anna-rose</p>
<p>industriously tried to trap her into saying, that she was the better of the two. but even so, the difference</p>
<p>entitled her to authority on the sub/"ect with anna-felicitas, and by dint of doing all her calculations roughly, as she</p>
<p>was careful to describe her method, she allowed room for withdrawal and escape where otherwise the inflexibility of figures might</p>
<p>have caught her tight and held her down while anna-felicitas looked on and was unable to respect her. evidently the</p>
<p>exchange was something beneficent, she decided to refoice in it in silence, accept whatever it did, and refrain from asking</p>
<p>questions. "so i did. of course. the exchange," she said, after a little. she gathered up the dollar bills</p>
