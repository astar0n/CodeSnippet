<p>orderly, and some attendant ghaffirs, who, feasting on the remains of the effendi s supper, kept watch. for hasha was noted for its robbers. it was even rumoured</p>
<p>that the egregious selamlik pasha, with the sugar plantation near by -- "trousers," dicky called him when he saw him on the morrow, because of the elephantine breeks</p>
<p>he wore -- was not averse to sending his abyssinian slaves through the sugar-cane to waylay and rob, and worse, maybe. by five o clock next day the</p>
<p>inspection was over. the streets had been swept for the excellency -- which is to say saadat -- the first time in a year. the prison had been</p>
<p>cleaned of visible horrors, the first time in a month. the last time it was ordered there had been a riot among the starving, infested prisoners; earth had</p>
<p>been thrown over the protruding bones of the dear lamented dead in the cemetery; the water of the ablution places in the mosque had been changed; the ragged</p>
<p>policemen had new putties; the kourbashes of the tax-gatherers were hid in their yeleks; the egregious pasha wore a greasy smile, and the submudir, as he conducted fielding</p>
<p>-- "whom god preserve and honour!" -- through the prison and through the hospital, where goat s milk had been laid on for this especial day, smirked gently</p>
<p>through the bazaar above his parisian waistcoat. but fielding, as he rode on selamlik pasha s gorgeous black donkey from assiout, with its crimson trappings, knew what proportion</p>
<p>of improvement this "hankypanl-2y," as dicky called it, bore to the condition of things at the last inspection. he had spoken little all day, and dicky had noticed</p>
<p>that his eye was constantly turning here and there, as though looking for an unwelcome something or somebody. at last the thing was over, and they were /"ust</p>
<p>crossing the canal, the old bahr-el-yusef, which cuts the town in twain as the river abana does damascus, when dicky saw nearing them a heavily-laden boat, a cross</p>
<p>between a thames house-boat and an italian gondola, being drawn by one poor raw-bone -- raw-bone in truth, for there was on each shoulder a round red place,</p>
<p>made raw by the unsheathed ropes used as harness. the beast s sides were scraped as a tree is barked, and the hind quarters gored as though by</p>
<p>a harrow, dicky was riding with the mamour of the district, fielding was a distance behind with trousers and the mudir. dicky pulled up his donkey, got off</p>
<p>and ran towards the horse, pale with fury; for he loved animals better than men, and had wasted his strength beating donkey-boys with the sticks they used on</p>
<p>their victims. the boat had now reached a point opposite the mudirieh, its stopping-place; and the raw- bone, reeking with sweat and blood, stood still and trembled, its</p>
<p>knees shaking with the strain /"ust taken off them, its head sunk nearly to the ground. dicky had hardly reached the spot when a figure came running to</p>
<p>the poor waler with a quick stumbling motion. dicky drew back in wonder, for never had he seen eyes so painful as these that glanced from the tortured</p>
<p>beast to himself -- staring, bulbous, bloodshot, hunted eyes; but they were blue, a sickly, faded blue; and they were english! dicky s hand was, on his pistol,</p>
<p>for his first impulse had been to shoot the rawbone; but it dropped away in sheer astonishment at the sight of this strange figure in threadbare dirty clothes</p>
<p>and riding-breeches made by shearing the legs of a long pair -- cut with an unsteady hand, for the edges were iagged and uneven, and the man s</p>
<p>bare leg showed above the cast-off putties of a policeman. the coat was an old khaki jacket of a .!i.DPV soldier, and, being scant of buttons, doubtful linen</p>
<p>showed beneath. above the hook- nose, once aristocratic, now vulture-like and shrunken like that of rameses in his glass case at ghizeh, was a tarboosh tilting forward over</p>
<p>the eyes, nearly covering the forehead. the figure must have been very tall once, but it was stooped now, though the height was still well above medium. hunted,</p>
<p>haunted, ravaged and lost, was the face, and the long grey moustache, covering the chin almost, seemed to cover an immeasurable depravity. dicky took it all in at</p>
<p>a glance, and wondered with a bitter wonder; for this was an englishman, and behind him and around him, though not very near him, were arabs, soudanese, and</p>
<p>fellaheen, with sneering yet apprehensive faces. as dicky s hand dropped away from his pistol, the other shot out trembling, graceful, eager fingers, the one inexpressibly gentlemanly thing</p>
<p>about him. "give it to me -- quick!" he said, and he threw a backward glance towards the approaching group -- fielding, the egregious pasha, and the rest.</p>
<p>dicky did not hesitate; he passed the pistol over. the lost one took the pistol, cocked it, and held it to the head of the waler, which feebly</p>
<p>turned to him in recognition. "good-bye, old man!" he said, and fired. the horse dropped, kicked, struggled once or twice, and was gone. "if you know the</p>
