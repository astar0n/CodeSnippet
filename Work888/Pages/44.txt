<p>working together. at least kate and adam were happy, for they were always working together. by tacit agreement, they left</p>
<p>polly the easy housework, and went themselves to the fields to wrestle with the rugged work of a farm. they</p>
<p>thought they "were shielding polly, teaching her a woman s real work, and being kind to her. polly thought they</p>
<p>were together because they liked to be; doing the farm work because it suited them better; while she had known</p>
<p>from babyhood that for some reason her mother did not care for her as she did for adam. she thought</p>
<p>at first that it was because adam was a boy. later, when she noticed her mother watching her even time</p>
<p>she started to speak, and interrupting with the never- failing caution: "now be careful! think before you speak! are you</p>
<p>sure?" she wondered why this should happen to her always, to adam never. she asked adam about it, but adam</p>
<p>did not know. it never occurred to polly to ask her mother, while kate was so uneasy it never occurred</p>
<p>to her that the child would notice or what she would think. the first time polly deviated slightly from the</p>
<p>truth, she and kate had a very terrible time. kate felt fully justified; the child astonished and abused. polly arrived</p>
<p>at the solution of her problem slowly. as she grew older, she saw that her mother, who always was charitable</p>
<p>to evenone else, was repelled by her grandmother, while she loved aunt ollie. older still, polly realized that she was</p>
<p>a reproduction of her grandmother. she had only to look at her to see this; her mother did not like</p>
<p>her grandmother, maybe mother did not like her as well as adam, because she resembled her grandmother. by the time</p>
<p>she was sixteen, polly had arrived at a solution that satisfied her as to why her mother liked adam better,</p>
<p>and always left her alone in the house to endless cooking, dishwashing, sweeping, dusting, washing, and ironing, while she hoed</p>
<p>potatoes, pitched hay, or sheared sheep. polly thought the nicer way would have been to do the housework together and</p>
<p>then go to the fields together; but she was a good soul, so she worked alone and brooded in silence,</p>
<p>and watched up the road for a glimpse of henry peters, who liked to hear her talk, and to whom</p>
<p>it mattered not a mite that her hair was lustreless, her eyes steel coloured, and her nose like that of</p>
<p>a woman he never had seen. in her way, polly admired her mother, loved her, and worked until she was</p>
<p>almost dropping for kate s scant, infrequent words of praise. so polly had to be content in the kitchen. one</p>
<p>day, having finished her work two hours before dinnertime, she sauntered to the front gate. how strange that henry peters</p>
<p>should be at the end of the field ioining their land. when he waved, she waved back. when he climbed</p>
<p>the fence she opened the gate. they met halfway, under the bloomful shade of a red haw. henry wondered who</p>
<p>two men he had seen leaving the bolt gate were, and what they wanted, but he was too polite to</p>
<p>ask. he merely hoped they did not annoy her. oh, no, they were only some men to see mother about</p>
<p>some business, but it was most kind of him to let her know he was looking out for her, she</p>
<p>got so lonely." mother never would let her go to the field with her. of course not! the field was</p>
<p>no place for such a pretty girl; there was enough work in the house for her. his sister should not</p>
<p>work in the field, if he had a sister, and polly should not work there, if she belonged to him;</p>
<p>no-sir-ee! polly looked at henry with shining, young girl eyes, and when he said she was pretty, her blue-gray eyes</p>
<p>softened, her cheeks pinked up, the sun put light in her hair nature had failed to, and lo and behold,</p>
<p>the marvel was wrought -- plain little polly became a thing of beauty. she knew it instantly, because she saw</p>
<p>herself in henry peters eyes. and henry was so amazed when this wonderful transformation took place in little polly, right</p>
<p>there under the red haw tree, that his own eyes grew big and tender, his cheeks flooded with red blood,</p>
<p>his heart shook him, and he drew to full height, and became possessed of an overwhelming desire to dance before</p>
<p>polly, and sing to her. he grew so splendid, polly caught her breath, and then she smiled on him a</p>
<p>very wondering smile, over the great discovery." and henry grew so bewildered he forgot either to dance or sing as</p>
<p>a preliminary. he merely, just merely, reached out and gathered polly in his arms, and held her against him, and</p>
<p>stared down at her wonderful beauty opening right out under his eyes. "little beautiful!" said henry peters in a hushed,</p>
<p>choking voice, "little beautiful!" polly looked up at him. she was even bit as beautiful as he thought her, while</p>
<p>he was so beautiful to polly that she gasped for breath. how did he happen to look as he did,</p>
<p>right under the red haw, in broad daylight? he had been hers, of course, ever since, shy and fearful, she</p>
<p>had first entered bates corners school, and found courage in his broad, encouraging smile. now she smiled on him, the</p>
<p>smile of possession that was in her heart. henry instantly knew she always had belonged to him, so he grasped</p>
<p>her closer, and bent his head. when henry went back to the plow, and polly ran down the road, with</p>
<p>the toy of the world surging in her heart and brain, she knew that she was going to have to</p>
<p>account to her tired, busy mother for being half an hour late with dinner; and he knew he was going</p>
<p>to have to explain to an equally tired father why he was four furrows short of where he should</p>
