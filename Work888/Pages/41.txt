<p>what else was going on in that mind? the sense of the night closing in? do not go gentle, please,</p>
<p>stay awhile with me. she got up and went over to the record cabinet. her mother still had her collection</p>
<p>of old 33s, today they Were called vinyl, with conductors from decades ago like bruno walter and arturo toscanini. she</p>
<p>found a ianacek string quartet, no. 2, a rare mono pressing by the old budapest string quartet fifty years ago,</p>
<p>and put it on the turntable, still loving those first crackling sounds that raise your anticipation, she remembered how nina</p>
<p>would put on a record in the evening, after dinner, with room-temperature scotch in hand, and make the family sit</p>
<p>and listen. she suspected that had a lot to do with her own desire to play the violin herself someday.</p>
<p>and then, in high school, she started lessons. better late than never. now, though, she sensed there was something nina</p>
<p>wanted to tell her and this was her way of setting the stage. after the music had played for almost</p>
<p>three minutes, nina listening with eyes closed as though in a rapture as the movement clawed its way toward an</p>
<p>initial theme in an elusive minor mode, she turned and looked at ally. "he didn t tell you he came</p>
<p>to see me, did he? seth?" "i guess he forgot," ally said. it was a lie neither of them believed.</p>
<p>"i ve been thinking over all he was trying to say. i didn t get everything at the time, but</p>
<p>i guess my feeble mind was recording it. now it s all coming back. he was talking about arthur and</p>
<p>his suicide-ally, we both know that s what it was-and how he felt responsible and how he was finally going</p>
<p>to be able to make up for all the harm he d done to me, and to you. but he</p>
<p>was worried you might not want to go along with this special treatment for me." she was studying ally, as</p>
<p>though searching for an answer. maria had discreetly departed for the kitchen. "he kept talking about this doctor he knew.</p>
<p>at this clinic. he swore this man could perform a miracle for me, he said i should do it, whether</p>
<p>you approved or not." ally looked at her, wondering what to say. this was getting too devious for words, then</p>
<p>nina went on. "i ll probably not remember anything about this by tomorrow, but i just wanted to tell you,</p>
<p>when you get as mentally addled as i am now, you compensate by developing your other senses, i call it</p>
<p>your sixth sense. and ally, i think he s involved in something that s evil. and he wants to draw</p>
<p>me into it, maybe both of us." she stopped carefully framing her words. "i sensed a kind of desperation about</p>
<p>him. i don t know exactly what it was." as ally listened the ianacek quartet swelling in the room, scratches</p>
<p>and all, she felt more and more like an utter dunce. she hadn t caught any of this in grant</p>
<p>s come-on, but now . . . nina was right about that sixth sense. but what could the real story</p>
<p>be? grant was more a simple con artist than some embodiment of evil. think the music man in designer threads,</p>
<p>not darth vader. evil was surely too strong a word he was just the consummate self-promoting hustler. the troubling part</p>
<p>was, he was so damned good at it. "mom, you re wonderful today. why don t we all three go</p>
<p>somewhere for brunch now? right now. there s a new french place /"ust down columbus that needs checking out," she</p>
<p>had an eerie foreboding it might be their last chance. "no, honey, you brought some smoked fish, didn t you?</p>
<p>that s all i want." nina dismissed the idea with a wave of her hand. "besides, no one in this</p>
<p>town knows how to brew a proper pot of tea." then, the next thing ally knew, she was back to</p>
<p>musing out loud about grant. "i can t stop wondering. he said this doctor he knows might work a miracle</p>
<p>for me. what am i supposed to think?" ally was trying to decide whether a glimmer of hope, even though</p>
<p>it was almost certainly false, might be a healthy tonic for nina /"ust now. "mom, grant gave me some materials</p>
<p>about that doctor, i ll read them tonight, i promise." she was listening to the ianacek quartet soar, and it</p>
<p>was bucking her up. "let me see what i can find out." "he wants me to start in right away,"</p>
<p>nina pressed. "i think he said there are some studies going on at this clinic, but they re almost over.</p>
<p>it s free now, and unless i go soon, i can t get in the program. he said he would</p>
<p>take me out there monday morning if i wanted. but if i go with anybody, i want it to be</p>
<p>you." he s such a bastard, ally thought. she glanced at maria, who d been watching from the kitchen door</p>
<p>and listening to all that had happened. she was looking very upset and she motioned ally toward the doorway with</p>
<p>her eyes. "let me get a glass of water, mom." she headed for the kitchen, "did you hear all the</p>
<p>things she s talking about?" she asked when they were out of earshot, maria nodded, "a lot of what your</p>
<p>mother said is true. it was very strange. at the time she acted like she didn t understand him. now</p>
<p>i realize she did. or maybe it all just came back to her." "what do you think is really 30""!</p>
<p>on?" ally was studying her, hoping to get at the truth. "she seems a lot better today." maria paused a</p>
<p>moment, "miss hampton, i don t believe your mother is going to be with us much longer. i saw my</p>
<p>own go through much the same thing. there s always a glimmer just before ..." she looked down and</p>
