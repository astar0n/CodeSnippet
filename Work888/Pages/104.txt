<p>believe he is here to get the man i told you of. mebbe that ain t all." "what more?" she</p>
<p>scoffed. "this fellow is the best range detective in the country. my notion is he s spying around about that</p>
<p>squaw creek raid." under the dusky skin she flushed angrily. "my notion is you re daffy, /"ed. talk sense, and</p>
<p>i ll listen to you. you haven t a grain of proof." "i may get some yet," he told her</p>
<p>sulkily. she laughed her disbelief. "when you do, let me know," and with that she gave her pony the signal</p>
<p>to more forward. nevertheless, she met the ranger at the foot of the little hill with distinct coldness. when he</p>
<p>came up to shake hands, she was too busy dismounting to notice. "your heart must be a good deal better.</p>
<p>i suppose lost valley agrees with you." she had swung down on the other side of the horse, and her</p>
<p>glance at him across the saddle seat was like a rapier thrust. he was aware at once of being in</p>
<p>disgrace with her, and it chafed him that he had no adequate answer to her implied charge. "my heart s</p>
<p>all right," he said a little gruffly. "yes, it seems to be, lieutenant," she trailed the reins and turned away</p>
<p>at once to find her father. the girl was disappointed in him. he had, in effect, lied to her. that</p>
<p>was bad enough; but she felt that his lie had concealed something, how much she scarce dared say. her tangled</p>
<p>thoughts were in chaos. one moment she was ready to believe the worst; the next, it was impossible to conceive</p>
<p>such a man so vile a spy as to reward hospitality with treachery. yet she remembered now that it had</p>
<p>been while she was telling of the fate of the traitor burke that she had driven him to his lie.</p>
<p>or had he not told it first when she pointed out lost valley at his feet? yes, it was at</p>
<p>that moment she had noticed his pallor. he had, at least, conscience enough to be ashamed of what he was</p>
<p>doing. but she recognized a wide margin of difference between the possibilities of his guilt. it was one thing to</p>
<p>come to the valley for an escaped murderer: it was quite another to use the hospitality of his host as</p>
<p>a means to betray the friends of that host. deep in her heart she could not find it possible to</p>
<p>convict him of the latter alternative. he was too much a man, too vitally dynamic. no; whatever else he was,</p>
<p>she felt sure he was not so hopelessly lost to decency. he had that electric spark of self-respect which may</p>
<p>coexist with many faults, but not with treachery. a bunch of young steers which had strayed from their range were</p>
<p>to be driven to the dillon ranch, and the boss of the rodeo appointed france and fraser to the task.</p>
<p>"yo ll have company home, honey," he told his daughter, "and yo ll be able to give the boys a</p>
<p>hand if they need it. these hill cattle are still some wild, though we ve been working them a week.</p>
<p>yo re a heap better cowboy than some that works more steady at the business." briscoe nodded. "you bet! i</p>
<p>ain t forgot that day arlie rode big timber with me two years ago. she wasn t sixteen then, but</p>
<p>she herded them hill steers like they belonged to a milk bunch." he spoke his compliment patly enough, but somehow</p>
<p>the girl had an impression that he was thinking of something else. she was right, for as he helped gather</p>
<p>the drive his mind was busy with a problem. presently he dismounted to tighten a cinch, and made a signal</p>
<p>to a young fellow known as slim leroy. the latter was a new and tender recruit to fed s band</p>
<p>of miscreants. he drew up beside his leader and examined one of the fore hoofs of his pony. "slim, i</p>
<p>m going to have dillon send you for the mail to-day. when he tells you, that s the first you</p>
<p>know about it. understand? you ll have to take the hill cut to iack rabbit run on your way in.</p>
<p>at the cabin back of the aspens, inquire for a man that calls himself johnson. if he s there, give</p>
<p>him this message: this afternoon from bald knob. remember." just those words, and nothing more. if he isn t there,</p>
<p>forget the message. you ll know the man you want because he is shy his trigger finger and has a</p>
<p>ragged scar across his right cheek. make no mistake about this, slim." "sure i won t." briscoe, having finished cinching,</p>
<p>swung to his saddle and rode up to say good-by to arlie. "hope you ll have no trouble with this</p>
<p>bunch. if you push right along you d ought to get home by night," he told her. arlie agreed carelessly.</p>
<p>"i don t expect any trouble with them. so-long, ied." it would not have been her choice to ride home</p>
<p>with the lieutenant of rangers, but since her father had made the appointment publicly she did not care to make</p>
<p>obiection. yet she took care to let fraser see that he was in her black books. the men rode toward</p>
<p>the rear of the herd, one on each side, and arlie fell in beside her old playmate, dick. she laughed</p>
<p>and talked with him about a hundred things in which steve could have had no part, even if he had</p>
<p>been close enough to catch more than one word out of twenty. not once did she even look his way.</p>
<p>quite plainly she had taken pains to forget his existence. "it was briscoe s turn the other day," mused the</p>
<p>texan. "it s mine now. i wonder when it will be dick s to get put out in the cold!"</p>
<p>nevertheless, though he tried to act the philosopher, it cut him that the high-spirited girl had condemned him. he</p>
