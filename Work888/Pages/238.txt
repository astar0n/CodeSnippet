<p>quickly at peter, then looked down again. "she s short of workers at the orphanage, and i m going to</p>
<p>help them out for a while. you know i love it there. i want to go. i ve been going</p>
<p>there every year since i was fifteen." "i know, but it s not safe there, and it s getting worse.</p>
<p>i don t want you to go." "it s fine. they don t have problems like that in the orphanages,</p>
<p>the missions. they ve never had any problems. it s fine. i need to go." "that s not true. people</p>
<p>are dying there every day. you can t go. no way." cindy s face contorted, her cheeks lit up with</p>
<p>a fiery red tint, and her eyes grew large. she looked him dead in his eyes and spoke very slowly.</p>
<p>"friends do not tell their friends where they can and cannot go. friends do not have that right. friends come</p>
<p>and go, and i m going." "i need you, cindy. i need you to stay  i  damn it,</p>
<p>you just shouldn t go there." her eyes now blazed. "are you that dense? peter, we will never be friends.</p>
<p>i will never get over the fact that you willfully and utterly used me. from the moment we first held</p>
<p>hands to when we embraced and when we kissed and when we first  you were just using me. you</p>
<p>never had any intention of, how did you say it? of anything more. you played me for such a fool.</p>
<p>please leave. just go home." chad and sarah sprang up like startled kittens when they heard the back door open</p>
<p>and quickly slam shut. iohan approached, holding two beers in one hand and a cigarette in the other. he put</p>
<p>a beer in chad s hand and said. "howzit, my bru? you do look bloody awful, eh?" chad squinted in</p>
<p>the fading light, trying to read iohan s expression. is this iohan my friend and mate or iohan the overprotective</p>
<p>father." or is it iohan the boozer, desperate to escape his ?ober state? "i m good. real good. hoe haan</p>
<p>dit met yo?" "of course you have ?omething. that s why you re wearing a bra, toady." iulia turned back</p>
<p>to her pillaging of the dresser. "wear ?omething nice, but beachworthy. holly, too." "why does holly have to go?" "don</p>
<p>t you want her to?" iulia held up a dark blue lace coverup, then rolled it and tucked it into</p>
<p>her beach bag. "well, yeah, but with terry..." sylvia looked to her sister as the older girl s blue eyes</p>
<p>shot to her. "what about terry?" there was no mistaking the defensive venom in her tone. sylvia managed a meek</p>
<p>smile, her interest in the newly discovered cleavage gone. "is there room?" "of course. now get packed and call holly.</p>
<p>he ll be here in an hour." holly showed up on their doorstep twenty minutes later, including the ten minute</p>
<p>walktime. she beamed, a toothy grin that was promising embarrassing slipups over the course of the day. sylvia pulled her</p>
<p>into the house and shut the front door. "iulia said behave, holly." sylvia raised an eyebrow. "what s up?" "i</p>
<p>got asked to the dance!" sylvia wished she d have warned her. "already? it s only the first week of</p>
<p>school." her scowl deepened. "what dance?" "the first dance: you know, the one that coincides with the high school homecoming</p>
<p>dance," holly s smile widened, "/"amie?" a brisk nod from holly. sylvia groaned. "great. good." "what about matt?" they settled</p>
<p>on the couch as iulia finished preening in her bedroom, "what about matt? he s my lab partner. that s</p>
<p>it," "what s this about matt?" iulia stepped into the room, her bag slung over one shoulder. "there is no</p>
<p>malt." just a lab rat we have in class." sylvia shot holly a glare. "oh. not that threadbare thing in</p>
<p>the science room, is it?" "no. this is a different rat." sylvia got to her feet and went down the</p>
<p>hall to her room, holly at her heels. "i ve got to finish packing." "terry will be here any minute.</p>
<p>since holly s already here, i called him; he s on his way over," iulia s voice sailed to them.</p>
<p>"i m all alone and nobody cares," sylvia said once in her room, sighing and grabbing her green onepiece swimming</p>
<p>suit and stuffing it into her beach bag. "don t be that way. the dance isn t for another five</p>
<p>weeks." holly stood in front of the mirror at sylvia s dresser and lifted her bikini top with both hands</p>
<p>beneath her oversized tshirt. "this top always makes me look smooshed." sylvia glanced at her friend s reflection, then went</p>
<p>back to packing a beach towel. "you don t look smooshed to me." "what s eating you, red?" holly sat</p>
<p>on the edge of the bed and watched sylvia cram a bottle of suntan lotion into the bag. "you ever</p>
<p>think ?omeone can be too perfect? that there s got to be a flaw ?omewhere?" the lotion didn t really</p>
<p>fit, and sylvia shoved it in again, trying to pull up the zipper. "oh. terry. he s not perfect, red."</p>
<p>holly wagged a finger at her. "he s a vampire, remember?" "i never said he s a vampire; that was</p>
<p>just a metaphorthingy," she pulled the zipper, and it rebelled by splitting midway down, "shit." "he s here!" iulia called</p>
<p>from the living room. "we re going!" terry s apartment was one of four in an apartment house, and located</p>
<p>two blocks from the edge of town. it was accessed by the community staircase that ran between the upper and</p>
<p>lower apartments, and a twisting fireescape from the back. they d only swung by because he had come straight from</p>
<p>a last minute meeting with a client in akron and hadn t packed yet. sylvia and holly waited in the</p>
<p>front room while terry and iulia went into his bedroom to pack his bag, their voices muffled, hers low</p>
