<p>started to drag the bodies of kirk s three companions out of his field of vision. he gathered his wits</p>
<p>at last. someone might discover his absence and spread the alarm. he continued up the ladder. althought he was sickened</p>
<p>by the loss of his comrades kirk knew he was the only one left who could possibly save the hundreds</p>
<p>left behind. this goaded him on and without a backward glance he climbed upward. when he reached the roof, he</p>
<p>climbed through the small opening, stood up and looked round. there in the distance he could see the faint glow</p>
<p>from the capitol area. the clean air blown in earlier from the sea left the moonless night sky clear and</p>
<p>brilliant. each star stood out and appeared to dance in the blackness. not a traceof the appalachai smoke contaminated the</p>
<p>atmosphere. he studied the edge of the roofline of the great building. in the dim light he spied the top</p>
<p>of a fire escape ladder. removing his shoes he tip-toed toward it, afraid his footpads might give him away to</p>
<p>those below. once kirk reached the ladder, he tired the shoelaces together, draped the shoes around his neck and started</p>
<p>down. he moved with less caution now. any moment they might discover he was gone and sound the alarm. throwing</p>
<p>caution to the wind, he almost repelled himself down. on the last flight of the escape ladder, kirk rode the</p>
<p>cantelevered stairway the rest of the way and iumped lightly to the ground. he was in a dark alley and</p>
<p>hesitated for a moment to put on his shoes. he was grateful the dress shoes were kid-leather soft, perfect for</p>
<p>running. he looked back toward the street in front the the theater. no, too logical, he thought and ran instead</p>
<p>toward the street behind the movie house. the alley was strewn with debris. the stench did nothing to help his</p>
<p>nausea. a cat squalled in the dark and a flurry of tiny feet passed in front of him to iump</p>
<p>with a bang onto a garbage can. kurk ran on. as he came to the street he turned toward the</p>
<p>capitol. this wide avenue was much like the one in front of the theater. he ran past block after block</p>
<p>of boarded up stores, shops, hotels and restaurants. from time to time he heard sounds of habitation from transient dwellers.</p>
<p>no help from them. they were fraid of the law. afraid of being thrown out of their cosy free housing.</p>
<p>there was an occasional high pitched laugh and more than once he heard angry voices. from time to time a</p>
<p>shadow would move along one side of the avenue or cross onto the street as if to way-lay the well</p>
<p>dressed runner. don t stop me!" prayed the young scientist as he ran on. the fresh air had revived him.</p>
<p>as he got his second wind, he feet began to fly over the debris strewn pavement. suddenly kirk had the</p>
<p>uneasy feeling something or someone following him. he wasn t just afraid for himself, but for the undreds left in</p>
<p>the theater and the millions across the world who myght be destroyed if he was recaptured. he had to reach</p>
<p>the military. the president. someone! as he ran on, he felt the hair rise on the back of his neck.</p>
<p>he was certain that on this lonely street, something was stalking him. the night was moonless and the street unlit</p>
<p>except for the dim glow from the occupied quarter of the city beyond. then he turned and saw it. in</p>
<p>the darkness behind of him was a moving shadow. a large shadow of some sort of vehicle. it was about</p>
<p>two blocks back and moving toward him. kirk stopped to listen. the was an almost imperceptible hum from that direction.</p>
<p>he moved quickly to the sidwalk to his left and into a store front entrance. in the dark he bumped</p>
<p>into something soft and yielding. a voice growled sleepily at him. "hey, watch it buddy." it was a transient asleep</p>
<p>on the concrete, and he sound startled kirk so he moved back into the street. he paused for a moment.</p>
<p>now he could hear new sounds--sounds from back in the direction of the theater, the noise of boots on pavement.</p>
<p>he looked around to see he was in the middle of a long block of deserted stores. there was no</p>
<p>cross street to duck down and escape. kirk moved back intot he shadows of a clothing store next to him.</p>
<p>he could see little in the gloom and when his eyes became accustomed to the dim light, he noticed though</p>
<p>the show-case windows were broken, there were heavy bars on them and the door was bolted. he was trapped. he</p>
<p>huddled behind some boxes, back in the darkness, hoping they wouldn t see him. kirk held his breath so he</p>
<p>could hear better. the sound of the boots was getting louder and the humming sound slowly increased in volume. for</p>
<p>what seemed forever, the marching feet echoed through the street and reverberated in and out of the empty buildings. louder</p>
<p>and louder the humming grew until it seemed to be nearly on top of him. "platoon, halt.-" came a command</p>
<p>from the street. kirk iumped, startled by the nearby sound. a spotlight beam scanned past his hiding place, and he</p>
<p>tried to push himself farther back into the shadows. "left face!" there was a shuffling sound of boots as the</p>
<p>men obeyed the order. "parade rest," there was the sound of metal as rifle or weapon butts hit the pavement,</p>
<p>the humming sound increased. it was coming from a large black, electric powered van. he could just make out a</p>
<p>silver streak down the side. it stopped just short of where the soldiers were standing. it s beacon scanned the</p>
<p>buildings. for a moment there was silence, then a new sound. a thin whining noise came from the van. kirk</p>
<p>looked toward it from behind the boxes. a moment later a strange periscope apparatus started to rise from the</p>
<p></p>
