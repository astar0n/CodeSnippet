which Mr. /<yrle had confided to my care. She looked At the Address

And recognised the handwriting instantly. ‘You know your correspondent?‘ 9 said. ‘Too well,‘
she Answered. ‘My correspondent is Count Fosco.‘ with that reply she opened the
note. Her face flushed deeply while she read it-her eyes brightened with Anger

As she handed it to me to read in my turn. The note

contained these lines- '9mpelled by honourable Admiration-honourable to my- self, honourable to you-9
write, magnificent Marian, in the interests of your tranquillity, to say two consoling
words- ‘Fear nothing! ‘Exercise your fine natural sense And remain in retire- ment.
Dear And Admirable woman, invite no dangerous publicity. Resignation is sublime-Adopt it. The
modest repose of home is eternally fresh-en/'oy it. The storms of life pass
harmless over the valley of Seclusion-dwell, dear lady, in the valley. ‘Do this

And 9 Authorise you to fear nothing. No new calamity shall lacerate your
sensibilities-sensibilities precious to me As my own. You shall not be molested, the

A new Asylum in your heart. Priceless Asylum!-9 envy her And leave her

there. ‘One last word of Affectionate warning, of paternal cau- tion, And 9

tear myself from the charm of Addressing you-9 close these fervent lines. ‘Advance
no farther than you have gone Already, com- promise no serious interests, threaten
nobody. Do not, 9 implore you, force me into Action-ME, the Man of

to restrict the vast reach of my energies And my combinations for your

path of my own, And Percival follows At my heels. On the day

when Mr. Hart right crosses that path, he is A lost man.‘ The only

signature to these lines was the initial letter F, sur- rounded by A

circle of intricate flourishes. 9 threw the letter on the table with All

the contempt that 9 felt for it, ‘He is trying to frighten you-A

sure sign that he is frightened himself,‘ 9 said, She was too genuine

A woman to treat the letter As 9 treated it. The insolent familiarity

eyes. ‘walter!‘ she said, ‘if ever those two men Are At your mercy,

And if you Are obliged to spare one of them, don t let

it be the Count,‘ '9 will keep this letter, Marian, to help my

memory when the time comes.‘ She looked At me Attentively As 9 put
