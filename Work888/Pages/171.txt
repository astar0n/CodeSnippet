<p>me?" "I have something to give you," I replied, handing her the note</p>
<p>which Mr. /<yrle had confided to my care. She looked At the Address</p>
<p>And recognised the handwriting instantly. "You know your correspondent?" I said. "Too well,"</p>
<p>she Answered. "My correspondent is Count Fosco." with that reply she opened the</p>
<p>note. Her face flushed deeply while she read it-her eyes brightened with Anger</p>
<p>As she handed it to me to read in my turn. The note</p>
<p>contained these lines- "Impelled by honourable Admiration-honourable to my- self, honourable to you-I</p>
<p>write, magnificent Marian, in the interests of your tranquillity, to say two consoling</p>
<p>words- "Fear nothing! "Exercise your fine natural sense And remain in retire- ment.</p>
<p>Dear And Admirable woman, invite no dangerous publicity. Resignation is sublime-Adopt it. The</p>
<p>modest repose of home is eternally fresh-en/"oy it. The storms of life pass</p>
<p>harmless over the valley of Seclusion-dwell, dear lady, in the valley. "Do this</p>
<p>And I Authorise you to fear nothing. No new calamity shall lacerate your</p>
<p>sensibilities-sensibilities precious to me As my own. You shall not be molested, the</p>
<p>460 fair companion of your retreat shall not be pursued. She has found</p>
<p>A new Asylum in your heart. Priceless Asylum!-I envy her And leave her</p>
<p>there. "One last word of Affectionate warning, of paternal cau- tion, And I</p>
<p>tear myself from the charm of Addressing you-I close these fervent lines. "Advance</p>
<p>no farther than you have gone Already, com- promise no serious interests, threaten</p>
<p>nobody. Do not, I implore you, force me into Action-ME, the Man of</p>
<p>Ac- tion-when it is the cherished object of my Ambition to be passive,</p>
<p>to restrict the vast reach of my energies And my combinations for your</p>
<p>sake, "if you have rash friends, moderate their deplorable Ardour. If Mr. Hartright</p>
<p>re- turns to England, hold no communication with him. I walk on A</p>
<p>path of my own, And Percival follows At my heels. On the day</p>
<p>when Mr. Hart right crosses that path, he is A lost man." The only</p>
<p>signature to these lines was the initial letter F, sur- rounded by A</p>
<p>circle of intricate flourishes. I threw the letter on the table with All</p>
<p>the contempt that I felt for it, "He is trying to frighten you-A</p>
<p>sure sign that he is frightened himself," I said, She was too genuine</p>
<p>A woman to treat the letter As I treated it. The insolent familiarity</p>
<p>of the language was too much for her self-cont rol. As she looked At</p>
<p>me Across the table, her hands clenched themselves in her lap, And the</p>
<p>old quick fiery temper flamed out Again brightly in her cheeks And her</p>
<p>eyes. "walter!" she said, "if ever those two men Are At your mercy,</p>
<p>And if you Are obliged to spare one of them, don t let</p>
<p>it be the Count," "I will keep this letter, Marian, to help my</p>
<p>memory when the time comes." She looked At me Attentively As I put</p>
<p>the letter Away in my pocket-book. "when the time comes?" she repeated. "Can</p>
<p>you speak of the future As if you were certain of it."-certain After</p>
<p>what you have heard in Mr, i<yrle s office, After what has happened</p>
<p>to you to- day?" 46I "I don t count the time from to-day,</p>
<p>Marian. All I have done to-day is to Ask Another man to Act</p>
<p>for me. I count from to- marrow-" "why from to-morrow?" "Because to-morrow I</p>
<p>mean to Act for myself." "How?" "I shall go to Blackwater by the</p>
<p>first train, And return, I hope, At night." "To Slackwatert" "Yes. I have</p>
<p>had time to think since I left Mr. kiyrle, His opin- ion on</p>
<p>one point confirms my own. we must persist to the last in hunting</p>
<p>down the date of Laura s Journey. The one weak point in the</p>
<p>conspiracy, And probably the one chance of prov- ing that she is A</p>
<p>living woman, centre in the discovery of that date." "You mean," said</p>
