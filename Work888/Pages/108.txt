<p>fell off," suggested the professor. "that would explain it. the esquimaux were traveling to this cave with us, and simply</p>
<p>brought us from where the ship had been blown, up to where the boys landed." "i guess that must be</p>
<p>it," admitted andy," "but listen! some one is coming." footsteps were heard approaching. in a few seconds dirola entered the</p>
<p>ice chamber. "i fix it!" she exclaimed. "you must all go way quick. the people want kill you, but me</p>
<p>save. listen. you climb up the slide me an boys come down. me bring sharp bones," and she brought out</p>
<p>from under her iacket several sharp bone picks. "make um steps in ice; climb up. go in little cave, where</p>
<p>boys know. there man wait for you wid sled an dogs. he take you to airship. but hurry, hurry! people</p>
<p>be after you soon when find you gone. me keep um back long what i can, but not for very</p>
<p>long, so you go fast." "we must lose no time," said the professor. "this may be our last chance. how</p>
<p>can we thank you, dirola?" "never mind talk, go!" exclaimed the esquimaux queen. "must hurry!" the captives were anxious enough</p>
<p>to escape. led by dirola they went out into the main cavern. it was quite dark, as the sun had</p>
<p>moved around so it no longer shone in the opening, and the mysterious lights had died away. they were soon</p>
<p>at the bottom of the slope by means of which the boys and the helpers had fallen into the ice</p>
<p>cave. "now climb up!" dirola commanded. "me give people big feast cause i back again. they eat an no think</p>
<p>of you for long time, but they chase when they find out. hurry! hurry!" it was no easy task for</p>
<p>the prisoners to make their way up the icy slope. each one was given a pair of short sharp-pointed heavy</p>
<p>bones. with these in their hands, using them much as a seal does his tusks, they managed to scramble up</p>
<p>the slippery incline. soon they found themselves able to enter the cave the boys, bill, tom and dirola had made,</p>
<p>through the opening from which they had tumbled. "good-bye," called dirola to them, as they passed out of her sight.</p>
<p>"good-bye," all called back softly, from the roof of the cavern. it was the last they were to see of</p>
<p>their kind friend. outside of the little cave they found a native waiting with a large sled, to which twenty</p>
<p>dogs were hitched. the esquimaux seemed to be watching for them, for he made a sign that they were to</p>
<p>get on a sled. no time was lost. dirola had evidently made her plans well and in haste. the dog</p>
<p>driver looked to see that his charges were safe, and then cracked his long whip. off went the sled at</p>
<p>a swift pace, the animals tugging at their harness. not a native was in sight save the one driving the</p>
<p>sled. they were all probably at the feast dirola had prepared in celebration of her home-coming. "this is the first</p>
<p>sled ride we ve had when we were not tied on like so much cordwood," observed andy. "now we have</p>
<p>a chance to observe the scenery." faster and faster went the sled. it was a calm clear cold day--or it</p>
<p>might have been night as far as time went, but the sun shone from a blue sky, it was very</p>
<p>cold, and the heavy furs made the adventurers none too warm. suddenly, as the party sped on, there came a</p>
<p>loud explosion. it was like a great cannon being fired. "what was that?" exclaimed andy, starting in alarm. with a</p>
<p>cry of fear the dog driver pointed behind him. looking over their shoulders, the escaping ones saw a great crack</p>
<p>in the ice field. in it showed the black waters of the ocean. ahead appeared an ever-widening black line, and</p>
<p>on either side it was the same. a large part of the ice field had become detached and was floating</p>
<p>out to sea. though they did not know it, the adventurers had driven over the water and away from the</p>
<p>land. "we are adrift on the ice!" cried andy. "we only escaped from one danger to fall into another!" for</p>
<p>a moment the realization of their horrible position struck all dumb. adrift on the great polar sea, they might freeze</p>
<p>to death before they again got near to the main land. the dogs continued to run on, approaching nearer the</p>
<p>ever-widening crack in front. the driver seemed to suddenly awaken to the danger. with a series of sharp commands he</p>
<p>brought the team to a halt. then, signing to the adventurers to get off the sled, he turned it over</p>
<p>on the side. next he unhitched the dogs, and fastened them by their thongs to his whip handle, which he</p>
<p>stuck in a crack in the ice. the beasts were thus secured at some distance from the sled. this done,</p>
<p>the esquimaux took the fur robes that had been on the sleigh, and, spreading them over the frame of the</p>
<p>vehicle, made a low but fairly large and comfortable tent. he motioned for the men and boys to crawl inside,</p>
<p>which they "were glad enough to do, to escape the bitter wind. then the native sat down in the low</p>
<p>doorway of the shelter and seemed willing to wait for whatever turned up. "it doesn t seem to worry him</p>
<p>much," observed andy. "he certainly has made us comfortable," said iack. "i wonder what we are going to do?" "wait</p>
<p>and see what turns up," advised the professor. "we are on a large ice floe. it may float for many</p>
<p>days, and, after a while, strike the main ice again. when it does we will escape." "yes, an what am</p>
<p>we goin to eat in dat time?" demanded washington. with a triumphant gesture iack pulled from his pocket a tin</p>
<p>can. it contained the patent condensed food capsules. "hurrah!" cried the professor on seeing it. "this will keep us</p>
