<p>his hand and held it. You ll come and see me again, won</p>
<p>t you? she asked. No, he said, shaking his head. It would make</p>
<p>me too envious to see you happy. He walked slowly away from her</p>
<p>house. After all she was right when she said he had never loved</p>
<p>her. He was disappointed, irritated even, but his vanity was more affected than</p>
<p>his heart. He knew that himself. And presently he grew conscious that the</p>
<p>gods had played a very good practical ioke on him, and he laughed</p>
<p>at himself mirthlessly. "it is not very comfortable to have the gift of</p>
<p>being amused at one s own absurdity. I.I3 of I241 Of Human Bondage</p>
<p>LXXX For the next three months Philip worked on subjects which were new</p>
<p>to him. The unwieldy crowd which had entered the Medical School nearly two</p>
<p>years before had thinned out: some had left the hospital, finding the examinations</p>
<p>more difficult to pass than they expected, some had been taken away by</p>
<p>parents who had not foreseen the expense of life in London, and some</p>
<p>had drifted away to other callings. One youth whom Philip knew had devised</p>
<p>an ingenious plan to make money; he had bought things at sales and</p>
<p>pawned them, but presently found it more profitable to pawn goods bought on</p>
<p>credit; and it had caused a little excitement at the hospital when someone</p>
<p>pointed out his name in police-court proceedings. There had been a remand, then</p>
<p>assurances on the part of a harassed father, and the young man had</p>
<p>gone out to bear the white Man s Surden overseas. The imagination of</p>
<p>another, a lad who had never before been in a town at all,</p>
<p>fell to the glamour of music-halls and bar parlours; he spent his time</p>
<p>among racing-men, tipsters, and trainers, and now was become a book-maker s clerk.</p>
<p>Philip had seen him once in a bar near Piccadilly Circus in II4</p>
<p>of 1241 Of Human 8ondage a tight-waisted coat and a brown hat with</p>
<p>a broad, flat brim. A third, with a gift for singing and mimicry,</p>
<p>who had achieved success at the smoking concerts of the Medical School by</p>
<p>his imitation of notorious comedians, had abandoned the hospital for the chorus of</p>
<p>a musical comedy. Still another, and he interested Philip because his uncouth manner</p>
<p>and interiectional speech did not suggest that he was capable of any deep</p>
<p>emotion, had felt himself stifle among the houses of London. He grew haggard</p>
<p>in shut-in spaces, and the soul he knew not he possessed struggled like</p>
<p>a sparrow held in the hand, with little frightened gasps and a quick</p>
<p>palpitation of the heart: he yearned for the broad skies and the open,</p>
<p>desolate places among which his childhood had been spent," and he walked off</p>
<p>one day, without a word to anybody, between one lecture and another; and</p>
<p>the next thing his friends heard was that he had thrown up medicine</p>
<p>and was working on a farm. Philip attended now lectures on medicine and</p>
<p>on surgery. On certain mornings in the week he practised bandaging on out-patients</p>
<p>glad to earn a little money, and he was taught auscultation and how</p>
<p>to use the stethoscope. He learned dispensing. He was taking the examination in</p>
<p>Materia Medica in Fuly, and it amused him II5 of 1241 Of Human</p>
<p>Bondage to play with various drugs, concocting mixtures, rolling pills, and making ointments.</p>
<p>He seized avidly upon anything from which he could extract a suggestion of</p>
<p>human interest. He saw Griffiths once in the distance, but, not to have</p>
<p>the pain of cutting him dead, avoided him. Philip had felt a certain</p>
<p>self-consciousness with Griffiths friends, some of whom were now friends of his, when</p>
<p>he realised they knew of his quarrel with Griffiths and surmised they were</p>
<p>aware of the reason. One of them, a very tall fellow, with a</p>
<p>small head and a languid air, a youth called Ramsden, who was</p>
