<p>as with a whisk her short skirts vanished into the darkness, the two spectators--miss bertha and miss monica williams--sat looking at each other in speechless amazement. for fifty</p>
<p>years they had peeped through that little window and across that trim garden, but never yet had such a sight as this come to confound them. "i wish,"</p>
<p>said monica at last, "that we had kept the field." "i am sure i wish we had," answered her sister. the cottage from the window of which the</p>
<p>misses williams had looked out stands, and has stood for many a year, in that pleasant suburban district which lies between norwood, anerley, and forest hill. long before</p>
<p>there had been a thought of a township there, when the metropolis was still quite a distant thing, old mr. williams had inhabited "the brambles," as the little</p>
<p>house was called, and had owned all the fields about it. six or eight such cottages scattered over a rolling country-side were all the houses to be found</p>
<p>there in the days when the century was young. from afar, when the breeze came from the north, the dull, low roar of the great city might be</p>
<p>heard, like the breaking of the tide of life, while along the horizon might be seen the dim curtain of smoke, the grim spray which that tide threw</p>
<p>up. gradually, however, as the years passed, the city had thrown out a long brick-feeler here and there, curving, extending, and coalescing, until at last the little cottages</p>
<p>had been gripped round by these red tentacles, and had been absorbed to make room for the modern villa. field by field the estate of old mr. williams</p>
<p>had been sold to the speculative builder, and had borne rich crops of snug suburban dwellings, arranged in curving crescents and tree-lined avenues. the father had passed away</p>
<p>before his cottage was entirely bricked round, but his two daughters, to whom the property had descended, lived to see the last vestige of country taken from them.</p>
<p>for years they had clung to the one field which faced their windows, and it was only after much argument and many heartburnings, that they had at last</p>
<p>consented that it should share the fate of the others. a broad road was driven through their quiet domain, the quarter was re-named "the wilderness," and three square,</p>
<p>staring, uncompromising villas began to sprout up on the other side. with sore hearts, the two shy little old maids watched their steady progress, and speculated as to</p>
<p>what fashion of neighbors chance would bring into the little nook which had always been their own. and at last they were all three finished. wooden balconies and</p>
<p>overhanging eaves had been added to them, so that, in the language of the advertisement, there were vacant three eligible swiss-built villas, with sixteen rooms, no basement, electric</p>
<p>bells, hot and cold water, and every modern convenience, including a common tennis lawn, to be let at U00 a year, or lf,500 purchase. so tempting an offer</p>
<p>did not long remain open. within a few weeks the card had vanished from number one, and it was known that admiral hay denver, v. c., c. b.,</p>
<p>with mrs. hay denver and their only son, were about to move into it. the news brought peace to the hearts of the williams sisters. they had lived</p>
<p>with a settled conviction that some wild impossible colony, some shouting, singing family of madcaps, would break in upon their peace. this establishment at least was irreproachable. a</p>
<p>reference to "men of the time" showed them that admiral hay denver was a most distinguished officer, who had begun his active career at bomarsund, and had ended</p>
<p>it at alexandria, having managed between these two episodes to see as much service as any man of his years. from the taku forts and the _shannon_ brigade,</p>
<p>to dhow-harrying off zanzibar, there was no variety of naval work which did not appear in his record; while the victoria cross, and the albert medal for saving</p>
<p>life, vouched for it that in peace as in war his courage was still of the same true temper. clearly a very eligible neighbor this, the more so</p>
<p>as they had been confidentially assured by the estate agent that mr. harold denver, the son, was a most quiet young gentleman, and that he was busy from</p>
<p>morning to night on the stock exchange. the hay denvers had hardly moved in before number two also struck its placard, and again the ladies found that they</p>
<p>had no reason to be discontented with their neighbors. doctor balthazar walker was a very well-known name in the medical world. did not his qualifications, his membership, and</p>
<p>the record of his writings fill a long half-column in the "medical directory," from his first little paper on the "gouty diathesis" in 185I to his exhaustive treatise</p>
<p>upon "affections of the vaso-motor system" in 1884? a successful medical career which promised to end in a presidentship of a college and a baronetcy, had been cut</p>
<p>short by his sudden inheritance of a considerable sum from a grateful patient, which had rendered him independent for life, and had enabled him to turn his</p>
