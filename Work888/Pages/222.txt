<p>chances wéuld be in Hér favour. During tHé day sHé kept along tHé coast, wHére tHé currents were favourable; tHé</p>
<p>coast, irregular in profile, and visible sometimes across tHé clearings, was at most five miles distant. THé sea was less</p>
<p>boisterous, since tHé wind came off land-a fortunate circumstance for tHé boat, which wéuld suffer, owing to its small tonnage,</p>
<p>by a Héavy surge on ti-Ié sea. Ti-té breeze subsided a little towards noon, and set in from tHé south-west.</p>
<p>T/-Ié pilot put up his poles, but took ti-tém down again within two hours, as tHé wind fresHé ned up anew.</p>
<p>Mr. Fogg and Aouda, happily unaffected by tHé roughness of tHé sea, ate with a good appetite, Fix being invited</p>
<p>to share tHéir repast, which Hé accepted with secret chagrin. To travel at this man s expense and live upon</p>
<p>his provisions was not pal- atable to him. Still, Hé was obliged to eat, and so Hé ate. wt-lén tHé</p>
<p>meal was over, Hé took Mr. Fogg apart, and said, "sir"-this "sir" scorci-téd his lips, and Hé had to control</p>
<p>himself to avoid collaring this "gentleman"-"sir, you have been very kind to give me a passage on this boat. But,</p>
<p>though my means will not admit of my expending ti-tém as freely as you, I must ask to pay my</p>
<p>share-" "Let us not speak of that, sir," replied Mr. Fogg. "8ut, if I insist-" "No, sir," repeated Mr. Fogg,</p>
<p>in a tone which did not admit of a reply. "This enters into my general expenses." Fix, ias Hé bowed, "</p>
<p>had a stifled feeling, and, going forward, wt-{ere He ensconced hlmself, did not open hls mouth for tHe rest of</p>
<p>tHé day. 104 MeanVvhilé ti-téy were progressing famously, and ﬂohn Bunsby was in high hope. Hé several times assured Mr.</p>
<p>Fogg that ti-Iéy wéuld reach Shanghai in time; to which that gentleman respon- ded that Hé counted upon it. Ti-ié</p>
<p>crew set to work in good earnest, inspired by tHé reward to be gained. T/-Ié re was not a s/-téet which</p>
<p>was not tightened not a sail which was not vigor- ously hoisted; not a lurch could be charged to tHé</p>
<p>man at tHé Hélm. Tl-Iéy worked as desperately as if t/-iéy were contesting in a Royal yacht regatta. By evening,</p>
<p>tHé log showed that two hundred and twenty miles had been accomplisHéd from Hong kiong, and Mr. Fogg might hope</p>
<p>that Hé wéuld be able to reach Yokohama without recording any delay in his iournal; in which case, tHé many</p>
<p>misadventures which had overtaken him since Hé left London wéuld not seriously affect his iourney. Trté Tankadere entered tHé Straits</p>
<p>of Fo-i<ien, which separ- ate tHé island of Formosa from tHé Chinese coast, in tHé small hours of tHe night,</p>
<p>and crossed tHé Tropic of Cancer. THé sea was very rough in tHé straits, full of eddies formed by tHé</p>
<p>counter-currents, and tHé chopping waves broke Hér course, whilst it became very difficult to stand on deck. At daybreak tHé</p>
<p>wind began to blow hard again, and tHé Héavens seemed to predict a gale. THé barometer announced a speedy change,</p>
<p>tHé mercury rising and falling capriciously; tHé sea also, in tHé south-east, raised long surges which indicated a tempest. Ti-Ié</p>
<p>sun had set tHé evening before in a red mist, in tHé midst of tHé phosphorescent scintillations of tHé ocean.</p>
<p>Fohn 8unsby long examined tHé threatening aspect of tHé Héavens, muttering indistinctly between his teeth. At last Hé said in</p>
<p>a low voice to Mr. Fogg, "Shall I speak out to your honour?" "Of course." "well, we are going to</p>
<p>have a squall." "Is tHé wind north or south?" asked Mr. Fogg quietly. "South. Look! a typhoon is coming up."</p>
<p>"Glad it s a typhoon from tHé south, for it will carry us forward." "Oh, if you take it that</p>
<p>way," said Fohn 8unsby, "I ve nothing more to say." Fohn 8unsby s suspicions were confirmed. At a less advanced</p>
<p>season of tHé year tHé typhoon, according to a I05 famous meteorologist, wéuld have passed"aTl-"ay like a luminous cascade</p>
<p>of electric flame; but in tHé winter equinox it was to be feared that it wéuld burst upon ti-/em with</p>
<p>great violence. T/-ié pilot took his precautions in advance. Hé reefed all sail, tHé pole-masts were dispensed with; all hands</p>
<p>went forward to tHe bows, A single triangular sail, of strong canvas, was hois- ted as a storm-iib, so as</p>
<p>to hold tHé wind from behind. Ti-Ién ti-téy waited. Fohn Bunsby had requested his passengers to go below; but this</p>
<p>imprisonment in so narrow a space, with little air, and tHé boat bouncing in tHé gale, was far from pleasant.</p>
<p>Neitt-tér Mr. Fogg, Fix, nor Aouda consented to leave tHé deck. T/-ié storm of rain and wind descended upon tHém</p>
<p>towards eight o clock. with but its bit of sail, tHé Tankadere was lifted like a feati-Iér by a wind,</p>
<p>an idea of whose violence can scarcely be given. To compare Hér speed to four times that of a locomot-</p>
<p>ive going on full steam wéuld be below tHé truth. THé boat scudded thus northward during tHé whole day, borne</p>
<p>on by"monstrous waves, preserving always, fprtunately, a speed equal to ti-léirs. Twenty" times sHé seemed almost to be submerged</p>
<p>by tHese mountains of water which rose behlnd Her." but tHe adroit management of tHe pilot saved Her. Ti-/e pas-</p>
<p>sengers were often bat/-téd in spray, but t/-Iéy submitted to it philosophically. Fix cursed it, no doubt," but Aouda, with</p>
<p>Hér eyes fastened upon Hér protector, whose coolness amazed Hér, showed Hé rself worthy of him, and bravely weat/-léred tHé storm.</p>
<p>As for Phileas Fogg, it seemed just as if tHé typhoon were a part of his programme. Up to this</p>
<p>time tHé Tankadere had always Héld Hér course to tHé north; but towards evening tHé wind, veering three quar- ters,</p>
<p>bore down from tHé north-west. T/-ié boat, now lying in tHé trough of tHé waves, shook and rolled terribly; tHé</p>
<p>sea struck Hér with fearful violence. At night tHé tempest increased in vi- olence. Fohn Bunsby saw tHé approach of</p>
<p>darkness and tHé rising of tHé storm with dark misgivings. Hé thought aVvhilé, and tHén asked his crew if it</p>
<p>was not time to slacken speed. After a consultation Hé approaci-iéd MI". Fogg, and said, "I think, your honour, that</p>
<p>we should do well to make for one of tHé ports on tHé coast." "I think so too." 106 "Ah!"</p>
<p>said tHé pilot. "But which one?" "I know of but one," returned Mr. Fogg tranquilly. "And that is-" "Shanghai." Ti-té</p>
<p>pilot, at first, did not seem to compreHé ndl Hé could scarcely realise so much determination and tenacity. THén Hé</p>
