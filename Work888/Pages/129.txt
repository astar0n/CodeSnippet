<p>she moved a little towards him. 80th felt that the formality of introduction</p>
<p>was out of place. He spoke to her. I ve been looking for</p>
<p>you all my life, he said. You ve come at last, she murmured.</p>
<p>will you dance with me? She surrendered herself to his outstretched hands and</p>
<p>they danced. (Philip always pretended that he was not lame.) She danced divinely.</p>
<p>I ve never danced with anyone who danced like you, she said. 560</p>

<p>together the whole evening. "I m so thankful that "I waited for you,</p>
<p>he said to her. "I knew that in the end I must meet</p>
<p>you. People in the ball-room stared. They did not care. They did not</p>
<p>wish to hide their passion. At last they went into the garden. He</p>
<p>flung a light cloak over her shoulders and put her in a waiting</p>
<p>cab. They caught the midnight train to Paris; and they sped through the</p>
<p>silent, star-lit night into the unknown. He thought of this old fancy of</p>
<p>his, and it seemed impossible that he should be in love with Mildred</p>
<p>Rogers. Her name was grotesque. He did not think her pretty; he hated</p>
<p>the thinness of her, only that evening he had noticed how the bones</p>
<p>of her chest stood out in evening-dress; he went over her features one</p>
<p>by one; he did not like her mouth, and the unhealthiness of her</p>
<p>colour vaguely repelled him. She was common. Her phrases, so bald and few,</p>
<p>constantly repeated, showed the emptiness of her mind." he recalled her Vulgar little</p>
<p>laugh at the jokes of the musical comedy; and he remembered the little</p>
<p>finger carefully extended when she held her glass to her mouth; her manners</p>
<p>like her conversation, were odiously genteel. He remembered her insolence; sometimes he had</p>
<p>felt 561 of 1241 Of Human Bondage inclined to box her ears; and</p>
<p>suddenly, he knew not why, perhaps it was the thought of hitting her</p>
<p>or the recollection of her tiny, beautiful ears, he was seized by an</p>
<p>uprush of emotion. He yearned for her. He thought of taking her in</p>
<p>his arms, the thin, fragile body, and kissing her pale mouth: he wanted</p>
<p>to pass his fingers down the slightly greenish cheeks. He wanted her. He</p>
<p>had thought of love as a rapture which seized one so that all</p>
<p>the world seemed spring-like, he had looked forward to an ecstatic happiness; but</p>
<p>this was not happiness." it was a hunger of the soul, it was</p>
<p>a painful yearning, it was a bitter anguish, he had never known before.</p>
<p>He tried to think when it had first come to him. He did</p>
<p>not know. He only remembered that each time he had gone into the</p>
<p>shop, after the first two or three times, it had been with a</p>
<p>little feeling in the heart that was pain: and he remembered that when</p>
<p>she spoke to him he felt curiously breathless. when she left him it</p>
<p>was wretchedness, and when she came to him again it was despair. He</p>
<p>stretched himself in his bed as a dog stretches himself. He wondered how</p>
<p>he was going to endure that ceaseless aching of his soul. 56"? of</p>
<p>1241 Of Human Bondage LVIII Philip woke early next morning, and his first</p>
<p>thought was of Mildred. It struck him that he might meet her at</p>
<p>Victoria Station and walk with her to the shop. He shaved quickly, scrambled</p>
<p>into his clothes, and took a bus to the station. He was there</p>
<p>by twenty to eight and watched the incoming trains. Crowds poured out of</p>
<p>them, clerks and shop-people at that early hour, and thronged up the platform:</p>
<p>they hurried along, sometimes in pairs, here and there a group of girls,</p>
<p>but more often alone. They were white, most of them, ugly in the</p>
<p>early morning, and they had an abstracted look; the younger ones walked</p>
