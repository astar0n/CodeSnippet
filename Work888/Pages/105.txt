<p>she said. "was it the same dream as yesterday?" "i don t remember." she wouldn t meet his gaze, so</p>
<p>she probably did remember, but paddington wasn t going to press her. instead, he shuffled over and put an arm</p>
<p>around her, "you re safe now," he said. lisa settled against him, heart hammering. "that s quite a blood-pumper you</p>
<p>ve got there," he said, for something to say. "is that a euphemism?" paddington couldn t return her widening smile.</p>
<p>in his mind, she snapped at him again. "just an observation," he said. lisa closed her eyes. her heart kept</p>
<p>crashing against paddington s chest; its pace slowed but it thumped as hard as ever. the phone pierced his peace.</p>
<p>with deep regret, paddington slid a hand off lisa and onto the bedside phone. "yeah?" "missing person," andrea said. "chief</p>
<p>conall thinks the southern station has better things to do with its time." "mum, it s my weekend off," paddington</p>
<p>said. "is she there?" "what does tha" "doesn t matter." as soon as she d heard about the computer, andrea</p>
<p>s opinion of lisa had sunken from "tolerable" to "unacceptable" and she d moved from encouraging their relationship to sabotaging</p>
<p>it, "i 1I: sure quentin can handle it," she said. "no." paddington sat up, eyes widening. sure, his mohure was</p>
<p>trying to get between him and lisa - and succeeding - but this was a crime. possibly. "he ll be</p>
<p>there in ten." paddington placed the handset back in the cradle and sat up, aware that lisa had turned to</p>
<p>stare at the ceiling. "sorry," he said. "i ll be back as soon as i can." lisa didn t look</p>
<p>at him. it had been a week since paddington had so much as mentioned betsy s attack and the awkward</p>
<p>divide between them was as wide as ever. that left only one possible cause_._ "iim, were you ever going to</p>
<p>bring it up?" she asked. ...and there it was. she said it so calmly paddington thought he imagined it. "no,"</p>
<p>he admitted. "your mohure came to talk to me," lisa said. "said you closed yourself off after i left." explanations</p>
<p>formed in paddington s mind, all the reasons why he d become what he was, but they d sound ridiculous</p>
<p>out loud. "it s better this way," he said at last. "it really meant that much to you?" paddington stared</p>
<p>out the window at the bright blue sky, stomach knotting. could he explain himself, even fifteen years later? was any</p>
<p>reason good enough? "then you should know that i didn t leave archi just because of you," lisa said. mitigating</p>
<p>factors didn t matter; he was the primary cause. he drove her away. "why did you come back?" he asked.</p>
<p>lisa lay at ease, eyes closed. "why didn t you leave?" "nah. you ve seen me fumbling at the computer;</p>
<p>how would i fare out there?" he asked. "little people, little problems, maybe that s all i m good for."</p>
<p>paddington s brown eyes searched lisa s face for somewhere safe to land. they dodged enemy fire before being shot</p>
<p>down. there were flames. "all right, i m a coward," paddington said. "is that what you re saying?" lisa smiled.</p>
<p>"i m not saying anything." "no, »V"§u re just lying there, silently insinuating," she sat forward until her lips were</p>
<p>an inch from his. "and i ll.._ insinuate all i want." "no! no time for insinuations now. quentin s already</p>
<p>on his way." paddington iumped out of bed, showered, and dressed in his black uniform. as he was starting breakfast,</p>
<p>lisa emerged, still in her night-slip and smoothing wild blonde hair. why had he said yes to working." why not</p>
<p>spend the day with lisa? what would it matter if he didn t find one missing person? there was a</p>
<p>knock at the door and, immediately, the sound of it opening. quentin rumbled along the passage, belt tingling. lisa made</p>
<p>no effort to cover herself up. "heya /"im__. lisa." he tipped his helmet at her and dropped a folder on</p>
<p>the table, imbuing the act with distaste for everything the southern station was and did. paddington kissed lisa goodbye and</p>
<p>grabbed his helmet. as quentin drove them south, paddington peeled open the case report. "norman winslow. never heard of him."</p>
<p>"lucky you." "that bad?" "worse." the streets became grimier, as though brooms didn t work so well the farther south</p>
<p>they "rent, or roofs were more difficult to repairing. the houses were new, too," none more than eighty years old.</p>
<p>the south had never really recovered from some big fire a while back; it had just limped along, only half</p>
<p>alive. they parked and approached winslow s workplace, a dull building that was, inside, one large room filled with ten</p>
<p>cheap desks. the floor undulated where the structure had been extended and the walls were three shades of dull orange.</p>
<p>seven people looked up when they entered. after a brief conversation with winslow s boss - a heavyset man who</p>
<p>hadn t seen winslow in a month, assumed that he was using his accumulated holiday time, and only reported winslow</p>
<p>missing so he could replace him - they spoke with the staff. none had seen him since monday the second</p>
<p>of april, twenty-six days ago, winslow s ridiculously-neat desk completely lacked a convenient note saying "starting one-month vacation tomorrow". still,</p>
<p>maybe that made this proper police work: someone was missing and paddington could be his only hope, a possibility highlighted</p>
<p>when quentin kissed the hand of the woman he was supposed to be questioning. "got anything?" paddington asked. "just a</p>
<p>date on friday!" quentin whispered. "what about denise? and rose?" "i won t tell them if you don t," he</p>
<p>said, wiggling his eyebrows. paddington would have lectured him on the merits of monogamy, but quentin didn t need relationship</p>
<p>advice, he was charismatic enough to get away with anything. hell, if paddington told denise about rose, quentin would probably</p>
<p>just introduce them. and they d become best friends. "let s try his house," paddington said. winslow s house</p>
