<p>he could; for he did not like to be called bad names. "it is a water-baby!" cried ellie; and of</p>
<p>course it was. "water-fiddlesticks, my dear!" said the professor; and he turned away sharply. there was no denying it. it</p>
<p>was a water-baby: and he had said a moment ago that there were none. what was he to do." he</p>
<p>would have liked, of course, to have taken tom home in a bucket. he would not have put him in</p>
<p>spirits. of course not. he would have kept him alive, and petted him (for he was a very kind old</p>
<p>gentleman}, and written a book about him, and given him two long names, of which the first would have said</p>
<p>a little about tom, and the second all about himself; for of course he would have called him hydrotecnon ptthmllnsprtsianum,</p>
<p>or some other long name like that; for they are forced to call everything by long names now, because they</p>
<p>have used up all the short ones, ever since they took to making nine species out of one. but -</p>
<p>what would all the learned men say to him after his speech at the british association? and what would ellie</p>
<p>say, after what he had just told her." there was a wise old heathen once, who said, "maxima debetur pueris</p>
<p>reverentia" - the greatest reverence is due to children; that is, that grown people should never say or do anything</p>
<p>wrong before children, lest they should set them a bad example. - cousin cramchild says it means, "the greatest respectfulness</p>
<p>is expected from little boys." but he was raised in a country where little boys are not expected to be</p>
<p>respectful, because all of them are as good as the president:- well, every one knows his own concerns best; so</p>
<p>perhaps they are. but poor cousin cramchild, to do him justice, not being of that opinion, and having a moral</p>
<p>mission, and being no scholar to speak of, and hard up for an authority - why, it was a very</p>
<p>great temptation for him. but some people, and i am afraid the professor was one of them, interpret that in</p>
<p>a more strange, curious, one-sided, left-handed, topsy-turvy, inside-out, behind-before fashion than even cousin cramchild; for they make it mean, that</p>
<p>you must show your respect for children, by never confessing yourself in the wrong to them, even if you know</p>
<p>that you are so, lest they should lose confidence in their elders. now, if the professor had said to ellie,</p>
<p>"yes, my darling, it is a water-baby, and a very wonderful thing it is; and it shows how little i</p>
<p>know of the wonders of nature, in spite of forty years honest labour. i was just telling you that there</p>
<p>could be no such creatures; and, behold! here is one come to confound my conceit and show me that nature</p>
<p>can do, and has done, beyond all that man s poor fancy can imagine. so, let us thank the maker,</p>
<p>and inspirer, and lord of nature for all his wonderful and glorious works, and try and find out something about</p>
<p>this one;" - i think that, if the professor had said that, little ellie would have believed him more firmly,</p>
<p>and respected him more deeply, and loved him better, than ever she had done before. but he was of a</p>
<p>different opinion. he hesitated a moment. he longed to keep tom, and yet he half wished he never had caught</p>
<p>him; and at last he quite longed to get rid of him. so he turned away and poked tom with</p>
<p>his finger, for want of anything better to do; and said carelessly, "my dear little maid, you must have dreamt</p>
<p>of water-babies last night, your head is so full of them." now tom had been in the most horrible and</p>
<p>unspeakable fright all the while." and had kept as quiet as he could, though he was called a holothurian and</p>
<p>a cephalopod; for it was fixed in his little head that if a man with clothes on caught him, he</p>
<p>might put clothes on him too, and make a dirty black chimney-sweep of him again. but, when the professor poked</p>
<p>him, it was more than he could bear; and, between fright and rage, he turned to bay as valiantly as</p>
<p>a mouse in a corner, and bit the professor s finger till it bled, "oh! ah! yah." cried he; and</p>
<p>glad of an excuse to be rid of tom, dropped him on to the seaweed, and thence he dived into</p>
<p>the water and was gone in a moment. "but it was a water-baby, and i heard it speak!" cried ellie.</p>
<p>"ah, it is gone!" and she iumped down off the rock, to try and catch tom before he slipped into</p>
<p>the sea. too late! and what was worse, as she sprang down, she slipped, and fell some six feet, with</p>
<p>her head on a sharp rock, and lay quite still. the professor picked her up, and tried to waken her,</p>
<p>and called to her, and cried over her, for he loved her very much: but she would not waken at</p>
<p>all. so he took her up in his arms and carried her to her governess, and they all went home;</p>
<p>and little ellie was put to bed, and lay there quite still; only now and then she woke up and</p>
<p>called out about the water-baby: but no one knew what she meant, and the professor did not tell, for he</p>
<p>was ashamed to tell. and, after a week, one moonlight night, the fairies came flying in at the window and</p>
<p>brought her such a pretty pair of wings that she could not help putting them on; and she flew with</p>
<p>them out of the window, and over the land, and over the sea, and up through the clouds, and nobody</p>
<p>heard or saw anything of her for a very long while. and this is why they say that no one</p>
<p>has ever yet seen a water- baby. for my part, i believe that the naturalists get dozens of them</p>
