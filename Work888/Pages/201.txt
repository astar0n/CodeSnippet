<p>our parting, and all her looks and tones, and the action of her</p>
<p>fingers while she knitted - even then I was pursuing, here and there</p>
<p>and everywhere, the caution Don t go home. when at last I dozed,</p>
<p>in sheer 652 of 865 Great Expectations exhaustion of mind and body, it</p>
<p>became a vast shadowy verb which I had to coniugate. Imperative mood, present</p>
<p>tense: Do not thou go home, let him not go home, let us</p>
<p>not go home, do not ye or you go home, let not them</p>
<p>go home. Then, potentially: I may not and I cannot go home; and</p>
<p>I might not, Could not, would not, and should not go home; until</p>
<p>I felt that I was going distracted, and rolled over on the pillow,</p>
<p>and looked at the staring rounds upon the wall again. I had left</p>
<p>directions that I was to be called at seven." for it was plain</p>
<p>that I must see wemmick before seeing any one else, and equally plain</p>
<p>that this was a case in which his watworth sentiments, only, could be</p>
<p>taken. It was a relief to get out of the room where the</p>
<p>night had been so miserable, and I needed no second knocking at the</p>
<p>door to startle me from my uneasy bed. The Castle battlements arose upon</p>
<p>my view at eight o clock. The little servant happening to be entering</p>
<p>the fortress with two hot rolls, I passed through the postern and crossed</p>
<p>the drawbridge, in her company, and so came without announcement into the presence</p>
<p>of wemmick as he was making tea for himself and the Aged. An</p>
<p>open door afforded a perspective view of the Aged in bed. 653 of</p>
<p>865 Great Expectations Halloa, Mr. Pip.-" said wemmick. You did come home, then?</p>
<p>Yes, I returned; but I didn t go home. That s all right,</p>
<p>said he, rubbing his hands. I left a note for you at each</p>
<p>of the Temple gates, on the chance. which gate did you come to."</p>
<p>I told him. I ll go round to the others in the course</p>
<p>of the day and destroy the notes, said T1-"emmick; it s a good</p>
<p>rule never to leave documentary evidence if you can help it, because you</p>
<p>don t know when it may be put in. I m going to</p>
<p>take a liberty with you, - would you mind toasting this sausage for</p>
<p>the Aged P.? I said I should be delighted to do it. Then</p>
<p>you can go about your work, Mary Anne, said wemmick to the little</p>
<p>servant; which leaves us to ourselves, don t you see, Mr. Pip? he</p>
<p>added, winking, as she disappeared. I thanked him for his friendship and caution,</p>
<p>and our discourse proceeded in a low tone, while I toasted the Aged</p>
<p>s sausage and he buttered the crumb of the Aged s roll. Now,</p>
<p>Mr, Pip, you know, said wemmick, you and I understand one another". we</p>
<p>are in our private and 654 of 865 Great Expectations personal capacities, and</p>
<p>we have been engaged in a confidential transaction before today. Official sentiments are</p>
<p>one thing. we are extra official. I cordially assented. I was so very</p>
<p>nervous, that I had already lighted the Aged s sausage like a torch,</p>
<p>and been obliged to blow it out. I accidentally heard, yesterday morning, said</p>
<p>wemmick, being in a certain place where I once took you - even</p>
<p>between you and me, it s as well not to mention names when</p>
<p>avoidable- Much better not, said I. I understand you. I heard there by</p>
<p>chance, yesterday morning, said wemmick, that a certain person not altogether of uncolonial</p>
<p>pursuits, and not unpossessed of portable property - I don t know who</p>
<p>it may really be - we won t name this person- Not necessary,</p>
<p>said I. - had made some little stir in a certain part of</p>
<p>the world where a good many people go, not always in gratification</p>
