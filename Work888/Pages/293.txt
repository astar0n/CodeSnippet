<p>was like coming to the surface of the water After deep diving, to</p>
<p>find myself once more on the outside of Mr. Fairlie s room, As</p>
<p>soon As I was comfortably established for the morning in my pretty little</p>
<p>studio, the first resolution At which I Arrived 44 was to turn my</p>
<p>steps no more in the direction of the Apart- ments occupied by the</p>
<p>master of the house, except in the very improbable event of his honouring</p>
<p>me with A special invitation to pay him Another visit. Having settled this</p>
<p>satisfactory plan of future conduct in reference to Mr. Fairlie, I soon recovered</p>
<p>the serenity of temper of which my employer s haughty familiarity And impudent</p>
<p>politeness had, for the moment, deprived me. The remaining hours of the morning</p>
<p>passed Away pleasantly enough, in looking over the drawings, Arranging them in sets,</p>
<p>trimming their ragged edges, And Accomplishing the other ne- cessary preparations in Anticipation</p>
<p>of the business of mount- ing them. I ought, perhaps, to have made</p>
<p>more progress than this; but, As the luncheon-time drew near, I grew restless</p>
<p>And unsettled, And felt unable to fix my Attention on work, even though</p>
<p>that work was only of the humble manual kind. At two o clock</p>
<p>I descended Again to the breakfast-room, A little Anxiously. Expectations of some interest</p>
<p>were connected with my Approaching reappearance in that part of the house. My</p>
<p>introduction to Miss Fairlie was now close At hand; And, if Miss Halcombe</p>
<p>s search through her mother s letters had pro- duced the result which</p>
<p>she Anticipated, the time had come for clearing up the mystery of the</p>
<p>woman in white. 45 8. when I entered the room, I found Miss</p>
<p>Halcombe And An eld- erly lady seated At the luncheon-table. The elderly lady,</p>
<p>when I was presented to her, proved to be Miss Fairlie s former</p>
<p>governess, Mrs. Vesey, who had been briefly described to me by my lively</p>
<p>companion At the breakfast-table, As possessed of "All the cardinal virtues, And counting</p>
<p>for nothing." I can do little more than offer my humble testimony to</p>
<p>the truthfulness of Miss Halcombe s sketch of the old lady s character.</p>
<p>Mrs. Vesey looked the per- sonification of human composure And female Amiability. A</p>
<p>calm enioyment of A calm existence beamed in drowsy smiles on her plump,</p>
<p>placid face. Some of us rush through life, And some of us saunter</p>
<p>through life. Mrs. Vesey SAT through life. Sat in the house, early And</p>
<p>late; sat in the garden; sat in unexpected window-seats in passages; sat (on</p>
<p>A camp-stool} when her friends tried to take her out walking; sat before</p>
<p>she looked At Anything, before she talked of Anything, before she Answered Yes,</p>
<p>or No, to the commonest question-Always with the same serene smile on her</p>
<p>lips, the same vacantly-Attentive turn of the head, the same snugly-comfortable position of</p>
<p>her hands And Arms, under every possible change of domestic circum- stances. A</p>
<p>mild, A compliant, An unutterably tranquil And harm- less old lady, who never</p>
<p>by Any chance suggested the idea that she had been Actually Alive since</p>
<p>the hour of her birth. Nature has so much to do in this</p>
<p>world, And is engaged in generating such A vast variety of co-existent productions,</p>
<p>that she must surely be now And then too flurried And confused to</p>
<p>distinguish between the different processes that she is carrying on At the same</p>
<p>time, Starting from this point of view, it will Always re- main my</p>
<p>private persuasion that Nature was Absorbed in mak- ing cabbages when Mrs. Vesey</p>
<p>was born, And that the good lady suffered the consequences of A vegetable</p>
<p>preoccupation in the mind of the Mother of us All. "Now, Mrs. "Vesey,"</p>
<p>said Miss Halcombe, looking brighter, sharper, And readier than ever, by contrast with</p>
<p>the undemon- strative old lady At her side, "what will you have? A</p>
<p>cutlet?" Mrs. Vesey crossed her dimpled hands on the edge of the</p>
