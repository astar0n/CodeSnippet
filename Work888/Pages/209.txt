<p>not a military or an economic one. we, the Macedonians, have survived through our culture and in our cultural space, often unaware</p>
<p>of it." "You mentioned the fight against the occupiers in world war II. But did you fight the Nazis as Macedonians or</p>
<p>as communists?" "The Liberation Movement had national and communist strands. After the territory was freed, the nationalists were persecuted or, like /<:iro</p>
<p>Gligorov, our first president, transferred to 8elgrade, to be closely monitored. The Macedonian national movement was always in coalition with the ethnic</p>
<p>minorities here. we inherited our multi-cultural tolerant pluralism from the Ottomans. This was the basis for our inclusive constitution that prevented the</p>
<p>strife that characterized all the other republics that succeeded Yugoslavia. True, nowadays, Macedonians distance themselves from the Albanians, but there is no</p>
<p>active preiudice, no political mobilization to discriminate against the minorities and, thus, bring about conflict. what I call the Macedonian momentum of</p>
<p>silence survives in the gap between active and passive prejudice: no acceptance, but tolerance and toleration. That s why all these early</p>
<p>warning reports fail. The Greek Ministry of Foreign Affairs is now making the same mistake by boasting that it has saved Europe</p>
<p>from embracing an unstable country." I ask: "Not entirely stable. The Albanians took up arms in 2001 and forced Macedonia s leaders</p>
<p>to sign the Ohrid Framework Agreement ..." "I welcome the changes that we introduced to the constitution in 2001, they had real-life</p>
<p>legal consequences. It was a new inclusive beginning, mediated by the foreign powers. Had we not faced an insurrection, we would still</p>
<p>have been forced to implement the very same changes by the European Union, on the way to accession. The Agreement is decried</p>
<p>by some Macedonians because they are enamored with language and its power. This is the result of fear, not reason. Language reform</p>
<p>{granting minorities the right to use their languages in some circumstances and settings - SV) is not the first step towards federalization.</p>
<p>The foreigners are right in this respect. Albanian hasn t become a second official language. It can be used only in very</p>
<p>particular cases. Of course, some constructive ambiguity here saved the day. The Albanians were told that the right to use their language</p>
<p>was a ma/"or accomplishment, the Macedonians were soothed with the promise that Albanian can and will be employed solely in a restricted</p>
<p>fashion. The language of the articles in the Ohrid Agreement is clear-cut, the interpretation helpfully ambiguous and allows everyone to save face</p>
<p>and declare victory ". "The Ohrid Agreement, I am told by foreigners, is the only state-reaffirming, functional compact ever signed in the</p>
<p>Balkans. All other agreements dealt with post-traumatic outcomes of state dissolution and the ensuing confusion. It is short, but has disproportional symbolic</p>
<p>significance. And don t forget that we did not negotiate directly with the insurgents. The USA and the EU guaranteed the equal-handed</p>
<p>implementation of any understanding we reached and this was good enough for everyone concerned." I inter/"ect: "Then why has the same formula</p>
<p>failed to work in the case of the name negotiations with Greece that have been going nowhere for 1I years with US</p>
<p>mediation? In NATO s March 2008 Bucharest Summit, Macedonia was not invited to ioin the alliance because it would not succumb to</p>
<p>Greek intransigence: Greece insisted that Macedonia should change its constitutional name to cater to Greek domestic political sensitivities..." Frckoski: "Macedonia is actually</p>
<p>not negotiating with Greece. They don t treat us as partners. It was the same with the Ohrid Agreement: we had dealings</p>
<p>with the Americans and that provided the insurgents with the legitimacy to reach a compromise ("If the Americans say it s OK,</p>
<p>then we can safely go for it!"}. we needed the mediators to allow the Albanians to strike a deal without being lynched</p>
<p>by their own extremists. And, you know what? This Agreement will survive because of the guarantees embedded in it. we have no</p>
<p>alternative. The current debate between Macedonians and Albanians is about interpretation, within the framework of the text, with a view to legal</p>
<p>instruments of the EU regarding minorities, cultural identities, and human rights. The Badinter principle has not been abused even once! (A principle</p>
<p>in the agreement that requires dual maiorities - of the entire parliaments and of the Albanian MPs to pass laws pertaining to</p>
<p>inter-ethnic issues - SV). Previous SDSM (socialist) governments made two breaches in this protective wall, though. They allowed the issuance of bilingual</p>
<p>passports, thus expanding the role of the Albanian language beyond the original scope: and they accredited Tetovo university, a chaotic institution that</p>
<p>openly defied the law, As for the Greeks, should they succeed in their quest to ostracize us and deny our identity, all</p>
<p>the others will climb on the bandwagon." the Bulgarians, the Serbs. I see no problem for us to adopt a composite name</p>
<p>such as the New Republic of Macedonia, Upper Macedonia, and so on. 8ut, we cannot give up the non-exclusive use of the</p>
<p>adiective and title Macedonian . we may discuss what it denotes: its cultural, linguistic, and historical connotations. what we cannot and will</p>
<p>not discuss is giving it up all together. This is the red line. Regrettably, the Greeks themselves have been changing their positions</p>
<p>and demands dizzyingly." - he sighs. On to the greater world. I suggest that Macedonia may have a Russian option or card</p>
<p>to play, Frckoski dismisses this scenario off-hand: "It is good that the Americans have shifted their intelligence base from Athens to Skop/"e,</p>
<p>This move may antagonize Greece and Serbia, where the Russian presence is increasing. Even Bulgaria may be reverting to its Russophile roots.</p>
<p>8ut, Macedonia must serve as the soft border between east and west. Macedonians should overcome their instinctive and misguided feelings about Russian</p>
<p>brotherhood and adhere to the national interests of Macedonia. Russia was always against an independent Macedonian state: an unstable entity, in their</p>
<p>view, that may ieopardize Russian interests, policies, and presence throughout the region. Moreover, Russia represents an attempt to link ethnic homogeneity to</p>
<p>Christian Orthodoxy which, if imported to Macedonia, will surely lead to the dreaded federalization. The new government can t say, as they</p>
<p>currently do: who cares about the Albanians? we must co-exist with the Albanians. It took us years to sever the umbilical cord</p>
<p>to Serbia s Commonwealth of states. The Serbs never forgave Gligorov for his role in this historic separation. Enough said." In 1II5,</p>
<p>an assassination attempt was made on President Kim: Gligorov s life. His face was disfigured, but his stature among Macedonians grew as</p>
<p>a result. "If you alone, of all your neighbors, serve as a forward base of the USA, you may find yourself as</p>
<p>isolated as Israel is in the Middle East." - I venture. "Isolation is our history." - Frckoski reacts gloomily - "Macedonia has</p>
<p>always been its neighbors nightmare. If our multiculturalism succeeds, the decline of their ethnically homogeneous model of statehood will hasten. we threaten</p>
<p>their very foundations. This is a semiotic clash between meanings, symbols, identities, language, approaches. Once we understand this, we will develop a</p>
<p>cohesive national consensus." Another subiect: the ruling coalition, led by Nikola Gruevski and the right-wing VMRO-DPMNE party, has just won the elections</p>
<p>with a landslide. "This is a counter-reformation, a reaction against the former political elites. It comes replete with its own ersatz</p>
