<p>those texts refer to the genus of all souls, i.e. to the fact that all souls are of the same</p>
<p>nature2I. On the contrary he says in the Puranas we find passages to the effect that Vamadeva has been liberated,</p>
<p>Shuck has been liberated. "if soul were one, since the liberation of all would take place on the liberation of</p>
<p>one the mention of diverse liberation s would be self contradictory30. .I. The soul is not considered by the Sankhya</p>
<p>bound to matter. Vt is not bound, nor is it liberated. Vt is free. It has a delusive semblance of</p>
<p>being bound. The nature of the soul is constant freedom and indifference to pleasure and pain alike31. 10. These are</p>
<p>the basic principals of the Sankhya philosophy. "In short, according to its doctrines Prakriti and Purush are enough in themselves</p>
<p>to and the idea of a creator is looked upon by the Sankhya as a mere redundant phantom of philosophy32.</p>
<p>11. we may now enter into the details of this philosophy, "In the first place let us ask kcapila what</p>
<p>the motive is for the creation of the universe. He mentions two motives; they might have appeared satisfactory to him</p>
<p>but to me his reply is not rational. He says that Prakriti created the universe for the emancipation of the</p>
<p>soul which is really though not apparently emancipated or, secondly, for the removal of itself, i.e. for the sake of</p>
<p>removing the actually real pain which consists of itself, as his commentator explains it33. "it the soul is essentially free</p>
<p>and essentially light, there was no necessity for Prakriti to interfere with the soul s infinite bliss. That soul is</p>
<p>really though not apparently emancipated means that it is really emancipated but appears to be not so. Gandhi s interpretation</p>
<p>of the phrase seems to be somewhat far fetched, but he is apparently following some commentator. The more natural interpretation</p>
<p>of the phrase should be: "Or we may say that Prakriti created the universe for the sake of itself ,</p>
<p>that is, for the sake of the removal of pain that really belongs to itself."/ls we have noted, in the</p>
<p>Sankhya philosopher s eyes pain is a phenomenon belongsing to Prakriti rather than to Purush. 12. Let us examine the</p>
<p>other stages of creation. "I told you in the beginning that from Prakriti sprang the Great Mind. what is this</p>
<p>Great Mind? /éapila says: Vt is intellect and iudgement or ascertainment is its peculiar modification; and Dharma, gyan, Vairagya, Aeshvarya</p>
<p>i,e, merit, knowledge, dispassion and supernatural power arise out of it when there is in it a superlative degree of</p>
<p>the first if the three qualities, i.e. Satv, purity or passivity. 8ut demerit, ignorance, non dispassion and want of supernatural</p>
<p>power arise out of it when there is in it a preponderance of the other two qualities34. From the great</p>
<p>principal the Greet Mind, we were told, is produced Ahankara i.e. self consciousness. "it is what makes the Ego. It</p>
<p>is the same as Antakaran i.e. the internal instrument35. we were also told that the eleven organs and five subtle</p>
<p>elements are produced from self consciousness. But there is this distinction that the eleventh organ, the mind proceeds from self</p>
<p>consciousness in which the first quality Satv, purity or passivity preponderates, while the other ten organs proceed from self consciousness</p>
<p>in which the second quality activity or passion predominates, and the five subtle elements proceed from self consciousness in which</p>
<p>the third quality darkness or grossness predominates36. "I have already enumerated the eleven organs. The popular opinion is that the</p>
<p>organs are formed of gross elements. But the Sankhya doctrine is that is not so because the Veda does not</p>
<p>support that view and we know that kcapila could not assume an attitude of direct opposition to the "Vedas3I. There</p>
<p>was another popular opinion about this mind organ. It was that it is eternal, but !<apila says that none of</p>
<p>the organs is eternal because the Vedas say so and because we see that they are destroyed.38 Further he says</p>
<p>that mind is the leading organ while the other ten are kinds of powers.3I All these organs are mere instruments.</p>
<p>As a king even without himself taking an active part becomes a warrior simply by employing an army, so does</p>
<p>the soul, although quiescent, through the different organs, become a seer, a speaker, a iudge and the like, merely by</p>
<p>reason of its proximity with these organs-N. There are some special properties belonging to the Great "Intellect, self consciousness and</p>
<p>the mind. Attention or thought is the special property of the "Intellect, conceit of personality is the property of self</p>
<p>consciousness, and decision and doubt of the mind41, while the five airs known as Pran etc. are the common properties</p>
<p>of all of them42. The modifications of the organs are Prman. Vipreya, Vikalp, Nidra, Smriti, evidence, chimera, sleep and memory.</p>
<p>Some of them are painful, and others not painful43. when these modifications cease to exist the soul comes to a</p>
<p>state of self quiet44. The Yoga philosophy has the same doctrine. The very word Yoga means concentration and is defined</p>
<p>as the suppression of the modifications of the thinking principal45. 13. we will go still deeper into iéapila s philosophy.</p>
<p>we have enumerated in the beginning the 25 principals commencing with Prakriti and ending with Purusa. Prakriti as Prakriti in</p>
<p>a state of equilibrium is unable to produce anything. Vt is only when equilibrium is disturbed that the creation follows.</p>
<p>Purush the soul itself is neither the producer nor the produced. whence is the human body created according to this</p>
<p>philosophy? /<:apila says that out of the remaining twenty three principals a pair of bodies sthool shreer and Sooksham shreer</p>
<p>gross body and subtle body originates.46 "In fact the twenty three principals act as the seed. out of which the</p>
<p>body is produced and the fact that the soul becomes conditioned by the 23 principals is the cause of its</p>
<p>going from one body to another in fact the cause of all mundane existence4I, and this mundane existence continues for</p>
<p>each soul so long as it does not discriminate the difference between soul and Prakriti48. "it should be noted how</p>
<p>ever that according to i<apila s theory the soul is not really fettered by matter, it only has a wrong</p>
<p>impression that it is fettered. Really it is quite free. Only it does not realize this fact so long as</p>
<p>it is in mundane existence. we come again to the pair of bodies the gross body and the subtle body.</p>
<p>The gross body usually though not always arises from father and mother, while the subtle body is a creation</p>
