<p>get a shave." "all right," said drouet, creaking off in his good shoes toward the elevator. the old butterfly was</p>
<p>as light on the wing as ever. on an incoming vestibuled pullman, speeding at forty miles an hour through the</p>
<p>snow of the evening, were three others, all related. "first call for dinner in the dining-car," a pullman servitor was</p>
<p>announcing, as he hastened through the aisle in snow-white apron and iacket. "i don t believe i want to play</p>
<p>any more," said the youngest, a black-haired beauty, turned supercilious by fortune, as she pushed a euchre hand away from</p>
<p>her. "shall we go into dinner?" inquired her husband, who was all that fine raiment can make. "oh, not yet,"</p>
<p>she answered. "i don t want to play any more, though." "/"essica," said her mother, who was also a study</p>
<p>in what good clothing can do for age, "push that pin down in your tie--it s coming up." jessica obeyed,</p>
<p>incidentally touching at her lovely hair and looking at a little iewel-faced watch. her husband studied her, for beauty, even</p>
<p>cold, is fascinating from one point of view. "well, we won t have much more of this weather," he said.</p>
<p>"it only takes two weeks to get to rome." mrs. hurstwood nestled comfortably in her corner and smiled. it was</p>
<p>so nice to be the mother-in-law of a rich young man--one whose financial state had borne her personal inspection. "do</p>
<p>you suppose the boat will sail promptly?" asked iessica, "if it keeps up like this?" "oh, yes," answered her husband.</p>
<p>"this won t make any difference." passing down the aisle came a very fair-haired banker s son, also of chicago,</p>
<p>who had long eyed this supercilious beauty. even now he did not hesitate to glance at her, and she was</p>
<p>conscious of it. with a specially coniured show of indifference, she turned her pretty face wholly away. it was not</p>
<p>wifely modesty at all. by so much was her pride satisfied. at this moment hurstwood stood before a dirty four</p>
<p>story building in a side street quite near the bowery, whose one-time coat of buff had been changed by soot</p>
<p>and rain. he mingled with a crowd of men--a crowd which had been, and was still, gathering by degrees. it</p>
<p>began with the approach of two or three, who hung about the closed wooden doors and beat their feet to</p>
<p>keep them warm. they had on faded derby hats with dents in them. their misfit coats were heavy with melted</p>
<p>snow and turned up at the collars. their trousers were mere bags, frayed at the bottom and wobbling over big,</p>
<p>soppy shoes, torn at the sides and worn almost to shreds. they made no effort to go in, but shifted</p>
<p>ruefully about, digging their hands deep in their pockets and leering at the crowd and the increasing lamps. with the</p>
<p>minutes, increased the number. there were old men with grizzled beards and sunken eyes, men who were comparatively young but</p>
<p>shrunken by diseases, men who were middle-aged. none were fat. there was a face in the thick of the collection</p>
<p>which was as white as drained veal. there was another red as brick. some came with thin, rounded shoulders, others</p>
<p>with wooden legs, still others with frames so lean that clothes only flapped about them. there were great ears, swollen</p>
<p>noses, thick lips, and, above all, red, blood-shot eyes. not a normal, healthy face in the whole mass; not a</p>
<p>straight figure; not a straightforward, steady glance. in the drive of the wind and sleet they pushed in on one</p>
<p>another, there were wrists, unprotected by coat or pocket, which were red with cold. there were ears, half covered by</p>
<p>every conceivable semblance of a hat, which still looked stiff and bitten. in the snow they shifted, now one foot,</p>
<p>now another, almost rocking in unison. with the growth of the crowd about the door came a murmur. it was</p>
<p>not conversation, but a running comment directed at any one in general. it contained oaths and slang phrases. "by damn,</p>
<p>i wish they d hurry up." "look at the copper watchin ." "maybe it ain t winter, nuther!" "i wisht</p>
<p>i was in sing sing." now a sharper lash of wind cut down and they huddled closer. it was an</p>
<p>edging, shifting, pushing throng. there was no anger, no pleading, no threatening words. it was all sullen endurance, unlightened by</p>
<p>either wit or good fellowship. a carriage went iingling by with some reclining figure in it. one of the men</p>
<p>nearest the door saw "look at the bloke ridin ." "he ain t so cold." "eh, eh, eh!" yelled another,</p>
<p>the carriage having long since passed out of hearing. little by little the night crept on. along the walk a</p>
<p>crowd turned out on its way home. men and shop-girls went by with quick steps. the cross-town cars began to</p>
<p>be crowded. the gas lamps were blazing, and every window bloomed ruddy with a steady flame. still the crowd hung</p>
<p>about the door, unwavering. "ain t they ever goin to open up?" queried a hoarse voice, suggestively. this seemed to</p>
<p>renew the general interest in the closed door, and many gazed in that direction. they looked at it as dumb</p>
<p>brutes look, as dogs paw and whine and study the knob. they shifted and blinked and muttered, now a curse,</p>
<p>now a comment. still they waited and still the snow whirled and cut them with biting flakes. on the old</p>
<p>hats and peaked shoulders it was piling. it gathered in little heaps and curves and no one brushed it off.</p>
<p>in the centre of the crowd the warmth and steam melted it, and water trickled off hat rims and down</p>
<p>noses, which the owners could not reach to scratch. on the outer rim the piles remained unmelted. hurstwood, who could</p>
<p>not get in the centre, stood with head lowered to the weather and bent his form. a light appeared through</p>
<p>the transom overhead. it sent a thrill of possibility through the watchers. there was a murmur of recognition. at</p>
