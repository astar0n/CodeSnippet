<p>Father : there is one that accuseth you, even Moses, in whom ye trust, For had ye believed Moses, ye</p>
<p>would have believed me ." for he wrote of me. But if ye believe not his writings, how shall ye</p>
<p>believe my words .I 6 The Feeding of the Five Thousand After these things Fesus went over the sea of</p>
<p>Galilee, which is the sea of Tiberias. And a great multitude followed him, because they saw his miracles which he</p>
<p>did on them that were diseased. 34 35 36 3I 33 3I 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 4I</p>
<p>1 2 225I ﬂohn 6 And Iesus went up into a mountain, and there he sat with his disciples. And</p>
<p>the passover, a feast of the ilews, was nigh. when ﬂesus then lifted up his eyes, and saw a great</p>
<p>company come unto him, he saith unto Philip, whence shall we buy bread, that these may eat .I And this</p>
<p>he said to prove him : for he himself knew what he would do. Philip answered him, Two hundred pennyworth</p>
<p>of bread is not sufficient for them, that every one of them may take a little. One of his disciples,</p>
<p>Andrew, Simon Peter s brother, saith unto him, There is a lad here, which hath five barley loaves, and two</p>
<p>small fishes : but what are they among so many .I And tlesus said, Make the men sit down. Now</p>
<p>there was much grass in the place. So the men sat down, in number about five thousand. And ﬂesus took</p>
<p>the loaves ." and when he had given thanks, he distributed to the disciples, and the disciples to them that</p>
<p>were set down ; and likewise of the fishes as much as they would. when they were filled, he said</p>
<p>unto his disciples, Gather up the fragments that remain, that nothing be lost. Therefore they gathered them together, and filled</p>
<p>twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves, which remained over and above unto them that had eaten.</p>
<p>Then those men, when they had seen the miracle that Fesus did, said, This is of a truth that Prophet</p>
<p>that should come into the world. when ﬂesus therefore perceived that they would come and take him by force, to</p>
<p>make him a king, he departed again into a mountain himself alone. Iesus walks on the Sea And when even</p>
<p>was now come, his disciples went down unto the sea, 3 4 5 6 I 8 I 10 11 12</p>
<p>I3 I4 15 16 2258 iohn 6 and entered into a ship, and went over the sea toward Capernaum. And</p>
<p>it was now dark, and Fesus was not come to them. And the sea arose by reason of a great</p>
<p>wind that blew. So when they had rowed about five and twenty or thirty furlongs, they see desus walking on</p>
<p>the sea, and drawing nigh unto the ship : and they Were afraid. But he saith unto them, It is</p>
<p>I ; be not afraid. Then they willingly received him into the ship : and immediately the ship was at</p>
<p>the land whither they went. The People Seek ﬂesus The day following, when the people, which stood on the other</p>
<p>side of the sea, saw that there was none other boat there, save that one whereinto his disciples were entered,</p>
<p>and that Iesus went not with his disciples into the boat, but that his disciples were gone away alone ;</p>
<p>(howbeit there came other boats from Tiberias nigh unto the place where they did eat bread, after that the Lord</p>
<p>had given thanks :) when the people therefore saw that ﬂesus was not there, neither his disciples, they also took</p>
<p>shipping, and came to Capernaum, seeking for ﬂesus. ﬂesus the Bread of Life And when they had found him on</p>
<p>the other side of the sea, they said unto him, Rabbi, when camest thou hither .I Fesus answered them and</p>
<p>said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Ye seek me, not because ye saw the miracles, but because ye did</p>
<p>eat of the loaves, and were filled. Labor not for the meat which perisheth, but for that meat which endureth</p>
<p>unto everlasting life, which the Son of man shall give unto you ." for him hath God the Father sealed.</p>
<p>Then said they unto him, what shall we do, that we might work the works of God .I 1I 18</p>
<p>1I 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 2I 28 225I Fohn 6 ﬂesus answered and said unto them, This</p>
<p>is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath sent. They said therefore unto him, what</p>
<p>sign showest thou then, that we may see, and believe thee .I what dost thou work .I Our fathers did</p>
<p>eat manna in the desert ." as it is written, He gave them bread from heaven to eat. Then ﬂesus</p>
<p>said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Moses gave you not that bread from heaven ," but my</p>
<p>Father giveth you the true bread from heaven, For the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven,</p>
<p>and giveth life unto the world. Then said they unto him, Lord, evermore give us this bread. And iesus said</p>
<p>unto them, I am the bread of life : he that cometh to me shall never hunger ," and he</p>
<p>that believeth on me shall never thirst. But I said unto you, That ye also have seen me, and believe</p>
<p>not. All that the Father giveth me shall come to me ; and him that cometh to me I will</p>
<p>in no wise cast out. For I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will</p>
<p>of him that sent me. And this is the Father s will which hath sent me, that of all which</p>
<p>he hath given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the last day. And this</p>
<p>is the will of him that sent me, that every one which seeth the Son, and believeth on him, may</p>
<p>have everlasting life : and I will raise him up at the last day. The iews then murmured at him,</p>
<p>because he said, I am the bread which came down from heaven. And they said, Is not this iesus, the</p>
<p>son of Voseph, whose father and mother we know .I how is it then that he saith, I came down</p>
<p>from heaven .I Fesus therefore answered and said unto them, Murmur not among yourselves, No man can come to me,</p>
<p>except the Father which hath sent me draw him : and I will raise him up at the last</p>
