<p>own dynamic, their immanent historicity as a dialectic of nature and the mastery of nature, not only has the same</p>
<p>essence as the external, but in itself resembles that other one, without imitating it, the aesthetic productive force is the</p>
<p>same as that of useful labor and has in itself the same teleology; and what might be called the aesthetic</p>
<p>relations of production, everything in which the productive force finds itself embedded and upon which it works, are sediments or</p>
<p>fingerprints of the social ones. the double character of art as autonomous and as fait social (social fact) incessantly infects</p>
<p>the zone of its autonomy. in such relations to the empirical, they save, neutralized, what men once experienced literally and</p>
<p>undividedly upon their existence and what drove spirit out from there. they participate in enlightenment because they don t lie;</p>
<p>the literalness of that which speaks out of them does not deceive. they are, however, real as answers to the</p>
<p>question-complex of that which comes to them from without. their own tension is valid in relation to that outside, the</p>
<p>fundamental levels of experience, which motivate art, are related to the obfective world, from which they recoil, the unresolved antagonisms</p>
<p>of reality recur in the artworks as the inherent problems of their form, that, not the inclusion of obiective moments,</p>
<p>defines the relation of art to society. the relations of tension in the artworks crystallize themselves purely therein and reach</p>
<p>the real essence through their emancipation from the existing facade of the external. art, choris (separated) from the empirically existent,</p>
<p>gains a stance to it in accordance with hegel s argument against kant, that as soon as one sets a</p>
<p>restriction, one already oversteps it in the setting and takes within itself that which was to be forbidden. this alone,</p>
<p>no moralizing, is the critique of the principle of l art-pour l art (art for art s sake), which makes</p>
<p>the chorismos {separation} of art to its one and all through abstract negation. the freedom of artworks, about which their</p>
<p>self-consciousness boasts and without which they would not be, is the cunning of their own reason. they tie all their</p>
<p>elements to that whose transcending constitutes their joy and back into which they threaten at any a modern voice for</p>
<p>marx capital, volume one, by karl marx translated by ben fowkes as part of new left review s "marx library",</p>
<p>vintage books, III.I, $I.I5. much has happened since das kapital was first translated into capital. some skeptics would say that</p>
<p>events-both in society and in our theoretical comprehension of reality-have overtaken that book. but this would be too superficial a</p>
<p>rejection for a work presenting such a fundamental analysis of the capitalist system. the relation of marx s publication to</p>
<p>subsequent history should be seen in its dialectical complexity. economic science, political theory and critical philosophy have been transformed by</p>
<p>marx s approach as by no other set of ideas. revolutions and social movements on every continent have proclaimed their</p>
<p>goals in terms of one or another interpretation of marxism. such pervasive historical influences necessarily react back upon the original</p>
<p>text and its vocabulary any reading of capital today is bound to be filtered through the lenses of recent history.</p>
<p>Clearing away the /"argon this is not to bemoan the fact that we read capital from the perspective of our</p>
<p>own situation. rather, it is a mark of the text s greatness that, like an important work of art, it</p>
<p>responds with renewed meaning to the present context. what is unfortunate is that many of the terms that marx innocently</p>
<p>used have since been codified into a dogmatic iargon. they con/"ure up images and interconnections that limit their significance and</p>
<p>distort their relevance to a non-violent democratic socialist movement within corporate america. iargon muffles the text s ability to speak</p>
<p>to us. the recovery of marx s contributions from their orthodox fetishism is a political as well as intellectual act.</p>
<p>for the transformation of critical thought into dogma serves the interests of established powers, not just well intentioned popularizers. it</p>
<p>has therefore been a priority of those who re/"ect entrenched party authority-e.g., such outsiders as the american new left, the</p>
<p>frankfurt school, the yugoslav philosophers-to stress marx s early works against economistic construals of capital, more recently, rigorous academic studies</p>
<p>have been carried out to combat the distortions of marx s later theories. (harrington s twilight of capitalism rehearses much</p>
<p>of this work.) the setting has thus been prepared for a modern appreciation of marx s mature masterpiece. a voice</p>
<p>appropriate to the times happily, we now have a truly fresh rendering into english of volume one of capital, a</p>
<p>fitting response to the theoretical needs and intellectual potentials of today. the clarity of the new translation allows anyone concerned</p>
<p>with changing the present world to follow the argument of marx s fully-developed theory, unencumbered by archaic formulations and cliched</p>
<p>phrases. the original translation took certain liberties in adapting a work aimed at german intellectuals to the english proletarian movement;</p>
<p>the recent one aims with great success at capturing literal accuracy in modern english usage. to-the-point footnotes have been added</p>
<p>to clarify marx s now obscure historical, political and literary references, while the original german of philosophically controversial concepts are</p>
<p>supplied parenthetically to permit fully informed interpretation. the traditional text of marx s volume is preceded by a lucid introduction</p>
<p>and overview by ernest mandel and followed by the never-before-translated session, "results of the immediate process of production," which marx</p>
<p>once wrote as a concluding summary to volume one. together, these additions aid the reader in discovering the work s</p>
<p>contemporary significance. a handle on today s problems now the serious student of society needs only concentration and perseverance to</p>
<p>follow marx s presentations on such timely themes as: what is capitalism? why its appeal." whence its shortcomings? how does</p>
<p>capitalism engender materialistic values and obfuscatory conceptualizations? why must we work for wages from bosses? does capitalism require substantial unemployment?</p>
<p>what are the structural implications of a shorter workweek? is modern technology molded by capitalist relations." can investment policies</p>
