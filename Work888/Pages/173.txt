<p>particles or waves. in fact," he leaned closer, "there s a thing called wave-particle duality, where we believe they are</p>
<p>waves and particles at the same time. imagine that!" kathy feigned an expression of astonishment, and arnold leaned ever more</p>
<p>closely to her. "everything is governed by particles," he continued. "even us. even us." the body is the most amazing</p>
<p>machine ever built and the brain is the control unit. do you know, some people say we have no free</p>
<p>will? and i concur. our brains are simply machines made of these particles built up into nerve cells called neurons,</p>
<p>and our apparently free choices are simply random choices between different neurons made by electrical signals in our brains- and</p>
<p>that is it! randomness: the law of the universe!" arnold opened his mouth into a wide grin as if expecting</p>
<p>kathy to fall at his feet in worship of his superior intellect; in reality, kathy appeared only faintly interested. she</p>
<p>was trying to please her new friend by keeping a look of interest plastered across her face but his words</p>
<p>bored her and her acting abilities were limited. in truth, she had been expecting something more impressive from a man</p>
<p>who carried himself so proudly, sensing kathy s lack of enthusiasm, arnold fell into a sort of sulk and fell</p>
<p>silent, kathy noticed a shadow pass briefly across his face as if an inner dark side was flashing before her:</p>
<p>he had, for a second, taken on the appearance of someone much creepier and moodier than she had seen him</p>
<p>before. yet it lasted but a second and he soon returned to his normal self: pompous and self-important, with an</p>
<p>undeserved sense of superiority, but unthreatening. kathy hoped it would not happen again. he turned the ignition and set off,</p>
<p>finally, it must be said that he was in no hurry to reach their destination. the car was cruising steadily</p>
<p>down the road, at least ten miles an hour below the speed limit. the iourney passed in silence for some</p>
<p>time. it was, however, a pleasant silence and kathy soon relaxed into her seat again. she even began to en/"oy</p>
<p>the ride. her driver was no longer talking to her, so she used the time to gaze out of the</p>
<p>window at the neighbourhood they Were passing through. it just so happened that they were presently driving through the old</p>
<p>neighbourhood where she grew up. through the window she could see her old secondary school, st. michael s grammar school.</p>
<p>it had been a fairly exclusive and reclusive school which, like all grammar schools, acted in some manner as a</p>
<p>shield to the outside world. this had its advantages: she had heard frightful stories from the local comprehensive school of</p>
<p>bullying, staff-pupil relationships, knives and drugs. it shamed her to this day to admit that she had been a bit</p>
<p>of a snob in her youth. upon leaving compulsory education, she had begun to socialise more with former comprehensive pupils</p>
<p>and finally learnt that most important of lessons: your origin and schooling do not determine Your personality or worth in</p>
<p>society, in hindsight, in fact, she realised that many of her current friends from common backgrounds were far nicer people</p>
<p>than those she had known while at the grammar school. she had been a bit of an over-achiever in her</p>
<p>schooldays... but, no, why do they call it over achiever? she suddenly thought to herself. is there some acceptable limit</p>
<p>to achievement, beyond which you should not pass? the thought occurred to her to be quite odd- for what is</p>
<p>an over-achiever? , she continued. she surveyed her school day successes: for one, her talent for iournalism and investigation had</p>
<p>manifested itself at a young age when she began to work for the school newspaper, "news4u". well, that s what</p>
<p>it had been called when she began: she had always found such titles, using numbers instead of words in an</p>
<p>attempt to appeal to the younger generation, quite patronising. as soon as she became editor of the paper, she changed</p>
<p>the name to the more respectable the tribune . it didn t help increase readership (in fact, some pupils complained</p>
<p>that the change of name was simply pretentious} but her following actions, such as creating special music and sport sections</p>
<p>within the paper, as well as adding a ioke and comedy section, did make the paper somewhat more popular. her</p>
<p>talent for investigation had shown itself during this period of her life. there had been a scandal in her last</p>
<p>year involving the headmaster having an affair with one of the students, which would have remained hidden, had it not</p>
<p>been for her powers of investigation. much was made of it at the time: it hadn t even entered the</p>
<p>rumour mill when it was published and the whole school had been in shock. nobody knew quite how she found</p>
<p>out, and she liked to keep it that way- she enjoyed the idea of her enemies being in fear of</p>
<p>her hidden prowess and quite fancied herself as a sort of ninja of words . kathy was enioying reminiscing about</p>
<p>her childhood when arnold tapped her on the shoulder. he was apparently eager to end the silence and start a</p>
<p>conversation with her. as she turned, she could see him looking at her with one of his unreadable stares and</p>
<p>felt naked before him, as if he were seeing her whole being simply by turning his eyes towards her, of</p>
<p>course, he was not, but such was the impression he made. it felt as if he was looking down on</p>
<p>her, too, and she began to feel uncomfortable once more. yet his conversation was simple. "where are you from?" he</p>
<p>began, "around here," she smiled nervously. "we ve just passed my old school, actually." "ah, the grammar school?" asked arnold.</p>
<p>"yes," confirmed kathy. at this he turned his eyes away from kathy and back to his driving. it was a</p>
<p>relief to be freed from his captivating glare. "i went to a catholic school," he began. he almost spat</p>
