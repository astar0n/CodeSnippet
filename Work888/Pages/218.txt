<p>gentleman salmon, who is generous enough to go down to the sea weighing five ounces, and to come back next</p>
<p>year weighing five pounds, without having cost the soil or the state one farthing." or was it like a scotch</p>
<p>stream, such as arthur clough drew in his "bothie":- "where over a ledge of granite into a granite bason the</p>
<p>amber torrent descended. . . . . beautiful there for the colour derived from green rocks under; beautiful most of</p>
<p>all, where beads of foam uprising mingle their clouds of white with the delicate hue of the stillness. . .</p>
<p>. cliff over cliff for its sides, with rowan and pendant birch boughs." . . . ah, my little man,</p>
<p>when you are a big man, and fish such a stream as that, you will hardly care, i think, whether</p>
<p>she be roaring down in full spate, like coffee covered with scald cream, while the fish are swirling at your</p>
<p>fly as an oar-blade swirls in a boat-race, or flashing up the cataract like silver arrows, out of the fiercest</p>
<p>of the foam; or whether the fall be dwindled to a single thread, and the shingle below be as white</p>
<p>and dusty as a turnpike road, while the salmon huddle together in one dark cloud in the clear amber pool,</p>
<p>sleeping away their time till the rain creeps back again off the sea. you will not care much, if you</p>
<p>have eyes and brains; for you will lay down your rod contentedly, and drink in at your eyes the beauty</p>
<p>of that glorious place; and listen to the water-ouzel piping on the stones, and watch the yellow roes come down</p>
<p>to drink and look up at you with their great soft trustful eyes, as much as to say, "you could</p>
<p>not have the heart to shoot at us?" and then, if you have sense, you will turn and talk to</p>
<p>the great giant of a gilly who lies basking on the stone beside you. he will tell you no fihs,</p>
<p>my little man; for he is a scotchman, and fears god, and not the priest; and, as you talk with</p>
<p>him, you will be surprised more and more at his knowledge, his sense, his humour, his courtesy; and you will</p>
<p>find out - unless you have found it out before - that a man may learn from his bible to</p>
<p>be a more thorough gentleman than if he had been brought up in all the drawing-rooms in london. no. it</p>
<p>was none of these, the salmon stream at harthover. it was such a stream as you see in dear old</p>
<p>bewick." bewick, who was born and bred upon them. a full hundred yards broad it was, sliding on from broad</p>
<p>pool to broad shallow, and broad shallow to broad pool, over great fields of Shingle, under oak and ash coverts,</p>
<p>past low cliffs of sandstone, past green meadows, and fair parks, and a great house of gray stone, and brown</p>
<p>moors above, and here and there against the sky the smoking chimney of a colliery. you must look at bewick</p>
<p>to see just what it was like, for he has drawn it a hundred times with the care and the</p>
<p>love of a true north countryman; and, even if you do not care about the salmon river, you ought, like</p>
<p>all good boys, to know your bewick. at least, so old sir iohn used to say, and very sensibly he</p>
<p>put it too, as he was wont to do: "if they want to describe a finished young gentleman in france,</p>
<p>i hear, they say of him, il sait son rabelais, but if i want to describe one in england, i</p>
<p>say, he knows his bewick. and i think that is the higher compliment." but tom thought nothing about what the</p>
<p>river was like. all his fancy was, to get down to the wide wide sea. and after a while he</p>
<p>came to a place where the river spread out into broad still shallow reaches, so wide that little tom, as</p>
<p>he put his head out of the water, could hardly see across. and there he stopped. he got a little</p>
<p>frightened. "this must be the sea," he thought. "what a wide place it is-" if i go on into it</p>
<p>i shall surely lose my way, or some strange thing will bite me. i will stop here and look out</p>
<p>for the otter, or the eels, or some one to tell me where i shall go." so he went back</p>
<p>a little way, and crept into a crack of the rock, just where the river opened out into the wide</p>
<p>shallows, and watched for some one to tell him his way: but the otter and the eels were gone on</p>
<p>miles and miles down the stream. there he waited, and slept too, for he was quite tired with his night</p>
<p>s iourney; and, when he woke, the stream was clearing to a beautiful amber hue, though it was still very</p>
<p>high. and after a while he saw a sight which made him iump up; for he knew in a moment</p>
<p>it was one of the things which he had come to look for. such a fish! ten times as big</p>
<p>as the biggest trout, and a hundred times as big as tom, sculling up the stream past him, as easily</p>
<p>as tom had sculled down. such a fish! shining silver from head to tail, and here and there a crimson</p>
<p>dot; with a grand hooked nose and grand curling lip, and a grand bright eye, looking round him as proudly</p>
<p>as a king, and surveying the water right and left as if all belonged to him. surely he must be</p>
<p>the salmon, the king of all the fish. tom was so frightened that he longed to creep into a hole,"</p>
<p>but he need not have been; for salmon are all true gentlemen, and, like true gentlemen, they look noble and</p>
<p>proud enough, and yet, like true gentlemen, they never harm or quarrel with any one, but go about their</p>
