<p>flown out of sight, she turned back to iamie and was a little shocked to see that he was already</p>
<p>looking at her. she realized he must have been watching her instead of the birds. nevertheless, she said, "that was</p>
<p>amazing! i ve never seen anything like that in london. did you...see them?" she asked, suddenly shy. "yes, i saw</p>
<p>them." he said, his eyes dancing with merriment. he grinned affectionately at her in a way that made her blush.</p>
<p>"you did not.-" she retorted weakly. "you were....watching me." she said, her voice trailing off. "i didn t need to</p>
<p>watch them. i ve seen them even year along with millions of other birds, but you___you are amazing to me</p>
<p>with your ginger hair___" he brought his hand up and fingered her hair, then skimmed his fingers along her law.</p>
<p>"___and your creamy skin and your lovely green eyes." "oh." she breathed. she was at a loss for words. but</p>
<p>this is what she wanted, wasn t it? this is why she had followed him. another gust of wind blew</p>
<p>those loose strands of hair across her face again and also flipped one corner of her collar completely over her</p>
<p>shoulder. she didn t make a move to pull it down, after all her hand was deliciously entrapped in iamie</p>
<p>s hand. and she knew that it would be all right to let him see her gown. if he didn</p>
<p>t approve, she would find out now, while they were alone, and they could go their separate ways, although it</p>
<p>would sadden her greatly. but if he did approve__.if it stirred him___if it enticed him__.a shiver of anticipation ran up</p>
<p>her spine. iamie s eyes automatically went to the bared space of her neck and chest and then the bodice</p>
<p>of her gown. she watched him as he studied the marvelous embroidery, an orchard scene, green grass along the waistline,</p>
<p>highly detailed cherry trees, birds and butterflies scattered throughout. two little beagles sat side by side on the grass. evelyn</p>
<p>had stitched the embroidery to perfection with the purposeful intention of attracting a suitor and when /"amie gasped, she knew</p>
<p>he had seen the placement of the cluster of cherries right at the peak of her breast, she didn t</p>
<p>stop him from staring." in fact her breathing deepened, emphasizing the rise and fall of her breasts in the loose</p>
<p>bodice. finally he raised his gaze and his eyes were smoldering. she was feeling a little dizzy herself. their eyes</p>
<p>met and she did nothing to break the contact. this is crazy, she thought. i am standing here with a</p>
<p>stranger and allowing him to hold my hand. i am allowing him to see my dress and he s going</p>
<p>to kiss me. i just know it and i m going to allow him to do that too. "did you</p>
<p>do the embroidery on your gown?" he asked. she nodded, her heart pounding. " tis beautiful." he said, his eyes</p>
<p>roving over her breasts again. "thank you." she whispered. "you do know that i am not really your cousin." he</p>
<p>said out of the blue, brushing the stray hairs off of her face with the lightest of touches. he stepped</p>
<p>closer to her so that his body touched hers, and she shivered, nodding dumbly, her heart beating wildly. "you do</p>
<p>know that this is absolutely insane." he said, putting his arm around her and pulling her unresisting body against him.</p>
<p>she nodded again, smiling a little. that s exactly what i was thinking! "and you do know that i am</p>
<p>going to kiss you," he said, his mouth mere centimeters from her lips. was that his way of giving her</p>
<p>a warning so that she could stop him if she didn t want him to kiss her? was that his</p>
<p>gentlemanly way? and would he stop? she didn t know and she didn t care, because right now with all</p>
<p>her being she wanted him to kiss her. she nodded again, her mouth slightly open, her gaze locked with him.</p>
<p>she could feel his heat, smell his sweat and all the other organic odors that had clung to his clothing:</p>
<p>horses, hay and dust, and she reveled in it. when he lowered his lips to hers, her eyes automatically closed.</p>
<p>his hand let go of her hand, only to hold her tighter to him with both hands now, and she</p>
<p>found herself reaching for him, wanting to touch him. his lips were warm and insistent, but not overly greedy, not</p>
<p>yet: and mindlessly she dropped the leashes, both hands now clutched his shoulders, feeling his solid muscles and strong bones</p>
<p>through the softness of the fabric of his shirt. then one hand slid up to the back of his neck</p>
<p>under his hair, it was just as she imagined it would be, soft, thick, and luxurious. she could feel his</p>
<p>hands doing the same, exploring her back, stroking her hair. she felt like she was being transported to the moon,</p>
<p>and then he was pulling away, gasping for air. "oh god." he groaned. he took one look at her and</p>
<p>she imagined she must look like a wanton. her face felt flushed; her lips swollen. but she didn t care</p>
<p>because he said, "again," and he kissed her again until she thought her da-dee!" the shriek coming from upstairs could</p>
<p>be heard throughout the entire house. it was quite clear that a certain little person wanted some immediate attention. robert</p>
<p>recognized that shriek and his head snapped up as if a scolding hand had slapped him on the back of</p>
<p>his head. "robin." he said. the mood had effectively been broken, "oh god, i ll never be able to reach</p>
<p>him before he tries to come down the stairs by himself." he grabbed his plate, looking for a place to</p>
<p>put it down. elizabeth stopped him by boldly placing her hand on his forearm. "will he be frightened of me</p>
<p>if i go up?" she asked, already rising and placing her plate on her chair. "no, he fancies pretty</p>
