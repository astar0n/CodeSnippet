<p>figures; but no violence -- above all, no violence. the bishop was an ecclesiastic, and he was a recluse. he</p>
<p>therefore did not understand what men are like when the passion of fighting is roused in them. he dreamed of</p>
<p>a bloodless revolution; he pictured the men voluntarily confessing the wisdom and the truth of the old religion. the event</p>
<p>proved that all human institutions rest on force, and cannot be upset without the employment of force. to be sure,</p>
<p>women cannot fight; but they had on their side the aid of superstition and the strong arms of the men</p>
<p>whom they led in superstitious chains. upstairs one of the girls played and sang old songs: the words were strange;</p>
<p>words and air went direct to the heart. lord chester listened disturbed and anxious, yet exultant. the professor pressed his</p>
<p>hand, "it is death or success," she whispered. "be of good cheer," in either event you shall be counted noble</p>
<p>among the men to come." when grace ingleby wished him good-night, she held his hand in hers with the firm</p>
<p>grasp of a sister. "you are one of us," she said frankly. "in this house we are all brothers and</p>
<p>sisters in hope and in religion. and if they found us out," she added with a laugh, "we should be</p>
<p>brothers and sisters in death. courage, my lord! there is all to gain." faith ingleby, the younger sister, who had</p>
<p>less ardour for the cause than for the men who were pledged to it, whispered low, as he took her</p>
<p>hand, -- "we know all about lady carlyon; and we pray daily for her, and for you. mother says she</p>
<p>is worthy to -- become -- to be raised -- to be -- " "what?" he asked, reddening; for the</p>
<p>girl hesitated and looked at him with a kind of awe. "queen of england." "don t anticipate, faith," said algy.</p>
<p>"considering, however, what we have come out of, it strikes me that we have nothing to lose, whatever we may</p>
<p>gain. come, chester, we want to have a quiet talk together as soon as the bishop goes to bed." --</p>
<p>-- they talked for nearly the whole night. there was so much to say; one subject after another was started;</p>
<p>there were so many chances to consider, -- that it was four o clock when they parted. algy found, somewhere</p>
<p>or other, a bottle of champagne. "come," he cried, "a stirrup-cup! i drink to the day when the "king shall</p>
<p>en/"oy his own again. " "algy!" said lord chester. "to think that you have deceived me!" "to think," he replied</p>
<p>laughing, "that we have dreamed of this day so long! what would our revolution be worth unless we were to</p>
<p>have our hereditary and rightful king for leader! yet, i confess it was hard to see you drawn daily closer</p>
<p>to us, and not to hold out hands to drag you in -- long ago. yes, the professor was right.</p>
<p>she is always right. she glories in her obedience to the bishop, but -- whisper, -- we all know very</p>
<p>well that the bishop does nothing without consulting her first, and nothing that she does not agree with. don t</p>
<p>be too sure, dear boy, about the supremacy of man." at seven in the morning, lord chester was roused from</p>
<p>an extremely disagreeable dream. he was, in this vision, being led off to execution, in company with the bishop, constance,</p>
<p>the professor, and grace ingleby. the duchess of dunstanburgh headed the procession, carrying the ropes in her own illustrious hand,</p>
<p>her face was terrible in its sternness. the chancellor was there, pointing skinny fingers, and saying "yah!" before him, within</p>
<p>five minutes walk, stood five tall and comely gallows, with running tackle beautifully arranged; also, in case there should be</p>
<p>any preference expressed by the criminals for fancy methods of execution, there were stakes and fagots, guillotines, wheels to be</p>
<p>broken upon, men with masks, and other accessories of public execution. it was therefore a relief, on opening his eyes,</p>
<p>to discover that he was as yet only a peaceful guest of professor ingleby, and that the great revolt had</p>
<p>not yet begun. "at all events," he said cheerfully, "i shall have the excitement of the attempt, if i am</p>
<p>to be hanged or beheaded for it. and most certainly it will be less disagreeable to be hanged than to</p>
<p>marry the duchess. perhaps even there may be, if one is lucky, an opportunity of telling her so. a last</p>
<p>dying speech of that kind would be popular." shaking off gloomy thoughts, therefore, he dressed hastily, and descended to the</p>
<p>hall, where most of the party of the preceding night were collected, waiting for him. the tinkling of a bell</p>
<p>which had awakened him now began again. algy dunquerque told him it was the bell for chapel. "but," he added,</p>
<p>"don t be afraid. it is not the kind of service we are accustomed to. there is no homily on</p>
<p>obedience; and, thank goodness, there is no perfect woman here!" the chapel was a long room, fitted simply with a</p>
<p>few benches, a table at the east end, a brass eagle for lectern, and some books. the professor and the</p>
<p>girls were already in their places, and in a few moments the bishop himself appeared, in lawn-sleeves and surplice. for</p>
<p>the first time lord chester witnessed the spectacle of a man conducting the services. it gave a little shock and</p>
<p>a momentary sense of shame, which he shook off as unworthy. a greater shock was the simple service of the</p>
<p>ancient faith which followed. to begin with, there were no flowers, no incense girls, no anthems, no pictures of sainted</p>
<p>women, no figures of the holy mother, no veiled perfect woman on an altar crowned with roses; and there were</p>
<p>no genuflections, no symbolical robes, no mystic whisperings, no change of dress, no pretence at mysterious powers. all was perfectly</p>
<p>simple -- a few prayers, a lesson from a great book, a hymn, and then a short address. the</p>
