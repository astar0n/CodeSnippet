<p>relieved it was still dry, he scraped the match across the bottom of the can and it flamed in the</p>
<p>dark. next he quickly pressed the wooden end into the soft gelignite, making a target he could see from a</p>
<p>distance. after checking it one last time, he rose and dashed for the safety of the nearest shed, pulling the</p>
<p>uzi from his belt and chambering a round. he leaned against a darkened wall and took careful aim, on semi-auto.</p>
<p>the gantry was only a meter away from the charge when he finally squeezed off a round. it kicked up</p>
<p>a spray of gravel next to the rails, the small stones glistening in the floodlights like small shining stars as</p>
<p>they erupted slightly to the left of where he had placed the charge. damn. he knew the match could be</p>
<p>seen, as well as the flare of the uzi, but maybe nobody was watching. in any case, he adjusted his</p>
<p>aim and quickly fired again. but this time he had moved the sight too far to the right. again the</p>
<p>gravel splayed, another sparkle under the lights, but once more nothing happened. now the gantry s wheels were about to</p>
<p>pass directly over the explosive. if the thing was going to be immobilized, he had one shot left. he took</p>
<p>careful aim and squeezed the trigger. . . . to the sound of a dull click. his last round had</p>
<p>misfired. "something s going on out there," ramirez yelled, grabbing helling s arm. "i saw flashes of light. somebody s</p>
<p>shooting. see it? over there." he was pointing. "that s exactly why i wanted to check it out." at last,</p>
<p>helling thought. maybe now he ll listen to reason. "look, i m going to shut this damned thing down right</p>
<p>now. till we know what s going on." he hit the control and applied the brakes. he had just squandered</p>
<p>his last rounds and his chance to cripple the gantry. he sighed involuntarily. c est la vie. at that instant,</p>
<p>however, whoever was manning the controls locked the wheels and there was the loud screech of metal on metal. he</p>
<p>watched the wheels slide across the patch of gelignite, creating instantaneous frictional heat. immediately a blinding white flare erupted from</p>
<p>the tracks, followed by the loud crack of an explosion. he watched as the first steel wheel was sheared away</p>
<p>and the gantry lurched awkwardly forward. next the axle ground into the gravel next to the track as the motion</p>
<p>of the giant tower tilted it askew. it had not toppled over, but it was leaning dangerously. whatever might be</p>
<p>required to repair it, the gantry was no longer functional. satcom was shut down for the foreseeable. he was less</p>
<p>than happy with his handiwork. cally s going to kill me-that was his first thought-after her long diatribe about not</p>
<p>doing any big damage. then he watched as it got worse. the gantry jerked again as the axle cracked from</p>
<p>the stress and began slowly to heel. like the slow crash of a tumbling redwood-he almost wanted to shout "timberrrr"-it</p>
<p>toppled forward, landing with an enormous crash that shook the very ground around him. angle-iron and lights splintered into the</p>
<p>granite-strewn soil that separated the launch pad from the rest of the facility. now the gantry lay like a fallen</p>
<p>giant. , , . as he watched, he slowly recognized he had achieved nothing but malicious damage. by collapsing, the</p>
<p>gantry was now out of the way, below the sight lines between the cyclops system on the mountain and the</p>
<p>vehicle. they still could launch. vx-1 must already be armed, he realized; the bomb is aboard and set to fly.</p>
<p>"goddammit i warned you it was a mistake," helling exploded, still stunned by the view out the window. the gantry</p>
<p>had just heeled over and collapsed onto the track. "at least it fell out of the way," bamirez declared calmly.</p>
<p>"no problem." he cursed himself for not taking helling s advice. for once the german had been right. "nothing s</p>
<p>changed. we launch on schedule. but right now we have some unfinished business." "what-?" "that bastard from up on the</p>
<p>mountain. he had to be the one responsible. i know it was him. i can smell it." he drew out</p>
<p>his Imm beretta and clicked off the safety, then angrily motioned for helling and headed out the door. "come on,</p>
<p>let s get the son of a bitch. i m going to kill him personally." vance rose and started walking</p>
<p>toward an opening he saw that led into the underground launch facility. maybe, he was thinking, he could slip into</p>
<p>launch control and somehow sabotage the vehicle itself. a dark tunnel branched off on his right-the lights were off-so he</p>
<p>probably could go directly okay, he thought, assume one of the bombs must already be installed on the first vehicle</p>
<p>and ready for launch. but given all the krytron detonators the pakistani had, there could well be more. maybe you</p>
<p>should try and find them, see what you can learn. could there be a way to disable the weapon now</p>
<p>poised up there without having to reach it? maybe disarm it electronically? he tried to guess what the firing mechanism</p>
<p>could be. clearly if you were planning to deliver a nuke, you were going to need some way to control</p>
<p>the detonation. so how did it work? maybe a pressure apparatus that could blow it on the way down, during</p>
<p>the reentry phase? why not? as the vehicle encountered denser and denser atmosphere, pressure could activate a switch that sensed</p>
<p>the altitude and instigated detonation at a preprogrammed height. or . . . another possibility was a radio-controlled device connected</p>
<p>to the guidance system in the computer. that would be trickier, but it might ultimately be more reliable. it also</p>
<p>might be easier to abort. in fact, the whole thing might be doable from here on the ground. . .</p>
<p>. but what if he got caught? his uzi was empty." cally had his walther; and nothing now stood</p>
