<p>it would be best to stay away until madame baumgarten should be informed by her husband of the agreement which had been made. he therefore made his way</p>
<p>down to the grﬁ"/gner mann, which was one of the favourite trysting-places of the wilder students, and ran, boisterously waving his cane in the air, into the little</p>
<p>parlour, where sat spiegler and m5"/zller and half a dozen other boon companions. "ha, ha! my boys," he shouted. "i knew i should find you here. drink up,</p>
<p>every one of you, and call for what you like, for i m going to stand treat to-day." had the green man who is depicted upon the signpost</p>
<p>of that well-known inn suddenly marched into the room and called for a bottle of wine, the students could not have been more amazed than they were by</p>
<p>this unexpected entry of their revered professor. they "Jere so astonished that for a minute or two they glared at him in utter bewilderment without being able to</p>
<p>make any reply to his hearty invitation. "donner und blitzen!" shouted the professor angrily. "what the deuce is the matter with you, then? you sit there like a</p>
<p>set of stuck pigs staring at me. what is it then?" "it is the unexpected honour," stammered spiegel, who was in the chair. "honour -- rubbish! said the</p>
<p>professor testily, "do you think that just because i happen to have been exhibiting mesmerism to a parcel of old fossils, i am therefore too proud to associate</p>
<p>with dear old friends like you." come out of that chair, spiegel, my boy, for i shall preside now. beer, or wine, or schnapps, my lads -- call</p>
<p>for what you like, and put it all down to me. never was there such an afternoon in the gré"/zner mann. the foaming flagons of lager and the</p>
<p>green-necked bottles of rhenish circulated merrily. by degrees the students lost their shyness in the presence of their professor. as for him, he shouted, he sang, he roared,</p>
<p>he balanced a long tobacco-pipe upon his nose, and offered to run a hundred yards against any member of the company. the kellner and the barmaid whispered to</p>
<p>each other outside the door their astonishment at such proceedings on the part of a regius professor of the ancient university of keinplatz. they had still more to</p>
<p>whisper about afterwards, for the learned man cracked the kellner s crown, and kissed the barmaid behind the kitchen door. "gentlemen," said the professor, standing up, albeit somewhat</p>
<p>totteringly, at the end of the table, and balancing his high old-fashioned wine glass in his bony hand, "i must now explain to you what is the cause</p>
<p>of this festivity." "hear! hear!" roared the students, hammering their beer glasses against the table; "a speech, a speech." -- silence for a speech!" "the fact is, my</p>
<p>friends," said the professor, beaming through his spectacles, "i hope very soon to be married." "married!" cried a student, bolder than the others. "is madame dead, then</p>
<p>who?" "why, madame von baumgarten, of course." "ha, ha!" laughed the professor; "i can see, then, that you know all about my former difficulties. no, she is not</p>
<p>dead, but i have reason to believe that she will not oppose my marriage." "that is very accommodating of her," remarked one of the company. "in fact," said</p>
<p>the professor, "i hope that she will now be induced to aid me in getting a wife. she and i never took to each other very much; but</p>
<p>now i hope all that may be ended, and when i marry she will come and stay with me." "what a happy family!" exclaimed some wag. yes, indeed;</p>
<p>and i hope you will come to my wedding, all of you. i won t mention names, but here is to my little bride!" and the professor waved</p>
<p>his glass "here s to his little bride!" roared the roysterers, with shouts of laughter. "here s her health. sie soll leben -- hoch!" and so the fun</p>
<p>waxed still more fast and furious, while each young fellow followed the professor s example, and drank a toast to the girl of his heart. while all this</p>
<p>festivity had been going on at the gré"/gner mann, a very different scene had been enacted elsewhere. young fritz von hartmann, with a solemn face and a reserved</p>
<p>manner, had, after the experiment, consulted and adjusted some mathematical instruments; after which, with a few peremptory words to the ianitor, he had walked out into the street</p>
<p>and wended his way slowly in the direction of the house of the professor. as he walked he saw von althaus, the professor of anatomy, in front of</p>
<p>him, and quickening his pace he overtook him. "i say, von althaus," he exclaimed, tapping him on the sleeve, "you were asking me for some information the other</p>
<p>day concerning the middle coat of the cerebral arteries. now i find -- " "donnerwetter!" shouted von althaus, who was a peppery old fellow. "what the deuce do</p>
<p>you mean by your impertinence! i ll have you up before the academical senate for this, sir": with which threat he turned on his heel and hurried</p>
<p>?" "madame</p>
