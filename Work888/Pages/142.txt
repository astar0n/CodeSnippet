<p>service of gift : and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death. And the Lord spake unto</p>
<p>Aaron, Behold, ? also have given thee the charge of mine heave offerings of all the hallowed things of the</p>
<p>children of Vsrael ," unto thee have I given them by reason of the anointing, and to thy sons, by</p>
<p>an ordinance for ever. This shall be thine of the most holy things, reserved from the fire : every oblation</p>
<p>of theirs, every meat offering of theirs, and every sin offering of theirs, and every trespass offering of theirs, which</p>
<p>they shall render unto me, shall be most holy for thee and for thy sons. "in the most holy place</p>
<p>shalt thou eat it ." every male shall eat it : it shall be holy unto thee. And this is</p>
<p>thine ; the heave offering of their gift, with all the wave offerings of the children of "israel ." I</p>
<p>have given them unto thee, and to thy sons and to thy daughters with thee, by a statute for ever</p>
<p>: every one that is clean in thy house shall eat of it. All the best of the oil, and</p>
<p>all the best of the wine, and of the wheat, the firstfruits of them which they shall offer unto the</p>
<p>Lord, them have "I given thee. And whatsoever is first ripe in the land, which they shall bring unto the</p>
<p>Lord, shall be thine I every one that is clean in thine house shall eat of it. Every thing devoted</p>
<p>in "Israel shall be thine. Every thing that openeth the matrix in all flesh, which they bring unto the Lord,</p>
<p>whether it be of men or beasts, shall be thine : nevertheless the firstborn of man shalt thou surely redeem,</p>
<p>and the firstling of unclean beasts shalt thou redeem. 5 6 I 8 I 10 1I I2 13 14 15</p>
<p>355 Numbers 18 And those that are to be redeemed from a month old shalt thou redeem, according to thine</p>
<p>estimation, for the money of five shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary, which is twenty gerahs. But the firstling</p>
<p>of a cow, or the firstling of a sheep, or the firstling of a goat, thou shalt not redeem ,"</p>
<p>they are holy : thou shalt sprinkle their blood upon the altar, and shalt burn their fat for an offering</p>
<p>made by fire, for a sweet savor unto the Lord. And the flesh of them shall be thine, as the</p>
<p>wave breast and as the right shoulder are thine. All the heave offerings of the holy things, which the children</p>
<p>of "Israel offer unto the Lord, have "I given thee, and thy sons and thy daughters with thee, by a</p>
<p>statute for ever : it is a covenant of salt for ever before the Lord unto thee and to thy</p>
<p>seed with thee. And the Lord spake unto Aaron, Thou shalt have no inheritance in their land, neither shalt thou</p>
<p>have any part among them ." I am thy part and thine inheritance among the children of Israel. And, behold,</p>
<p>I have given the children of Levi all the tenth in "Israel for an inheritance, for their service which they</p>
<p>serve, even the service of the tabernacle of the congregation. Neither must the children of Israel henceforth come nigh the</p>
<p>tabernacle of the congregation, lest they bear sin, and die, 8ut the Levites shall do the service of the tabernacle</p>
<p>of the congregation, and they Shall bear their iniquity ." it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations,</p>
<p>that among the children of "israel they have no inheritance, But the tithes of the children of "israel, which they</p>
<p>offer as a heave offering unto the Lord, Â¢ have given to the Levites to inherit : therefore "I have</p>
<p>said unto them, Among the children of "israel they shall have no inheritance. And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,</p>
<p>Thus speak unto the Levites, and say unto them, when ye take of the children of "israel the tithes which</p>
<p>I have given you from them for your inheritance, then ye shall offer up a heave offering of it for</p>
<p>the Lord, even a tenth part of the tithe. 3"6 1I 18 II 20 23" 22 23 24 25 26</p>
<p>356 Numbers II And this your heave offering shall be reckoned unto you, as though it were the corn of</p>
<p>the threshingfloor, and as the fulness of the winepress. Thus ye also shall offer a heave offering unto the Lord</p>
<p>of all your tithes, which ye receive of the children of Israel ; and ye shall give thereof the Lord</p>
<p>s heave offering to Aaron the priest. Out of all your gifts ye shall offer every heave offering of the</p>
<p>Lord, of all the best thereof, even the hallowed part thereof out of it. Therefore thou shalt say unto them,</p>
<p>when ye have heaved the best thereof from it, then it shall be counted unto the Levites as the increase</p>
<p>of the threshingfloor, and as the increase of the winepress. And ye shall eat it in every place, ye and</p>
<p>your households ." for it is your reward for your service in the tabernacle of the congregation, And ye shall</p>
<p>bear no sin by reason of it, when ye have heaved from it the best of it : neither shall</p>
<p>ye pollute the holy things of the children of "Israel, lest ye die, 1.I The Purification of the Unclean And</p>
<p>the Lord spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, This is the ordinance of the law which the Lord hath</p>
<p>commanded, saying, Speak unto the children of "Israel, that they bring thee a red heifer without spot, wherein is no</p>
<p>blemish, and upon which never came yoke. And ye shall give her unto Eleazar the priest, that he may bring</p>
<p>her forth without the camp, and one shall slay her before his face : and Eleazar the priest shall take</p>
<p>of her blood with his finger, and sprinkle of her blood directly before the tabernacle of the congregation seven times,</p>
<p>And one shall burn the heifer in his sight ," her skin, and her flesh, and her blood, with her</p>
<p>dung, shall he burn : and the priest shall take cedar wood, and hyssop, and scarlet, and cast it into</p>
<p>the midst of the burning of the heifer. 2I 28 2I 30 31 32 1 2 3 4 5 6</p>
<p>35I Numbers II Then the priest shall wash his clothes, and he shall bathe his flesh in water, and afterward</p>
<p>he shall come into the camp, and the priest shall be unclean until the even. And he that burneth</p>
