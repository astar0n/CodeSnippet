<p>of a patch of lilies, floating on top of a lake. she couldn t imagine anyone living out there, floating</p>
<p>on a giant life raft in the middle of the ocean. "beautiful isn t it?" a rich gravelly voice sald.</p>
<p>iane turned around to see a dark-skinned man with graying hair standing behind her. he wore an elaborate blue navy</p>
<p>iacket festooned with medals and tassels on top of a simple pair of ieans and a black t-shirt. somehow he</p>
<p>looked familiar. "you are the captain i presume?" iane asked. he looked surprised. "oh no," he responded. then he looked</p>
<p>down at his jacket. "oh this thing? this just came with the ship when i bought it. i m bryce</p>
<p>kandari." he held out his hand. "at your service." "bryce kandari," she repeated, taking his hand. "you re the famous</p>
<p>video game developer." he shrugged. "so how did you end up with an aircraft carrier?" she asked. "run out of</p>
<p>ferraris to buy?" bryce chuckled. "actually, i like to think about this as doing my part. this is the u,s.s.</p>
<p>nimitz, commissioned back in 1II5. she was our first nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, but she wasn t built to last forever.</p>
<p>back in the 2020 s, the navy began decommissioning the nimitz, but then the medicare crisis of 2025 hit. with</p>
<p>the federal government facing bankruptcy, they couldn t afford the hundreds of millions of dollars it takes to safely decommission</p>
<p>and store a nuclear carrier. being the patriot that i am, i offered to take it off their hands, sans</p>
<p>armament of course, and even stimulated the economy by hiring lots of people to fix it up." "the ladies dig</p>
<p>it more than a dozen ferraris," he added, giving her a wink. "you must admit that this makes a pretty</p>
<p>cool yacht." "it does," she agreed. "but why does the ecc need it?" "it doesn t," he replied. "this has</p>
<p>nothing to do with the ecc. it s my home. some people retire, buy an r.v., and travel across the</p>
<p>country. my mobile home is a little bigger and allows me to fly guests in when needed." "wow, rich people</p>
<p>really are crazy," she sald. "no dear," he sald. "poor people are crazy. rich people are eccentric. i paid a</p>
<p>million dollars for a certificate that says so." he looked completely serious. her eye caught something on the horizon. "what</p>
<p>s that?" she asked, pointing to a white speck in the water. "that s one of the trawling ships," he</p>
<p>responded. "gyre island has four of them. they travel out to different sections of the patch every day, dragging special</p>
<p>collection gear, essentially large perforated buckets, along the sides. at the end of the day, they bring back all the</p>
<p>plastic pellets back to the island for recycling." "they do the recycling on the island?" she asked. it seemed crazy</p>
<p>to put a recycling plant way out here. "oh yes," he replied. "that s what all the solar arrays are</p>
<p>for. you need a whole lot of energy to re-melt all that plastic. of course you could do the recycling</p>
<p>on land, but they "ion t really pick up enough plastic to make it worth the long trip back and</p>
<p>forth to the mainland. instead, gyre island uses all the plastic it recycles. the floating island originally just housed a</p>
<p>small recycling plant. every year they add pontoons, making the island larger and larger. the residential accommodations are made from</p>
<p>recycled plastic as is all the furniture. there are now one hundred volunteers who live on this island. as they</p>
<p>pick up more and more garbage from the oceans, the island gets bigger and bigger," "that s fascinating, so the</p>
<p>ecc pro/"ect is a success then," ff?! sald. "no," sald bryce sharply. "it s not. every day, ships from every</p>
<p>country that borders the pacific leave port carrying tons of garbage. ignoring whatever laws the international community has created and</p>
<p>not enforced, they dump all of it into the ocean and get paid for it. our solution is to use</p>
<p>more ships, burning more fuel, to go around looking for that same trash that is now scattered throughout a vast</p>
<p>swath of ocean and pick it up again. We collect a tiny fraction of what is dumped every day and</p>
<p>expend far more energy trying to pick it up than they do to dump it." bryce turned to her. "so</p>
<p>no, this is not a success." iane looked confused. "then why are you here?" she asked, "i m here for</p>
<p>two reasons," he explained. "first of all, we re now in international waters. i need a base to operate independently,</p>
<p>and not just to avoid liquor taxes. that s why i acquired the nimitz, and that s why i ve</p>
<p>taken over the ecc to get gyre island." /ane nodded tentatively. "and second of all, i m here and by</p>
<p>extension, you re here because of the one hundred people that live on gyre island. more than anywhere else in</p>
<p>the world, gyre island is an example of a small, closed ecosystem. thousands of miles from the closest city, they</p>
<p>ve created a self-sustaining environment. all their energy comes from the sun. they then use this energy to desalinate water.</p>
<p>that Water is used to grow plants which provide food for the inhabitants. and as mentioned, raw materials come from</p>
<p>the trash floating all around them." "interesting," iane sald, "but that still doesn t explain why a reclusive and wealthy</p>
<p>video game developer has obtained my research as ransom to get me to come to his floating vacation home." "hold</p>
<p>on there," bryce obiected. "contrary to what you may believe, video games are not the enemy of this earth. i</p>
<p>have just as much reason to save our planet and significantly more vision and resources to do so than anyone</p>
<p>else. this is not a vacation home. the lessons we can learn from the gyre island ecosystem will play a</p>
<p>critical role in my most crucial endeavor to date. pro/"ect phoenix is the single most important proiect in the</p>
