<p>overhaul that car!" ander?on turned to see why his order had not been obeyed. he looked angry. nash made hurried</p>
<p>motions. the car trembled, the machinery began to whir-then came a tremendous buzzing roar, a violent faaking of the car,</p>
<p>followed by sharp explosions, and silence. "you stripped the gears!" shouted ander?on, with the red fading out of his face.</p>
<p>"no; but ?omething s wrong," replied nash. he got out to examine the engine. ander?on manifestly controlled strong feeling. lenore</p>
<p>saw iake s hand go to her father s shoulder. "boss," he whispered, "we can t ketch thet car now."</p>
<p>ander.?on resigned himself, averted his face ?o that he could not see nash, who was tinkering with the engine. lenore</p>
<p>believed then that nash had deliberately stalled the engine or di?ordered ?omething, ?o as to permit the escape of the</p>
<p>strange car ahead. she saw it turn off the long, straight road ahead and disappear to the right. after ?ome</p>
<p>minutes delay nash resumed his seat and started the car once more. from the top of the next hill lenore</p>
<p>saw the dorn farm and home. all the wheat looked parched. she remembered, however, that the section of promising grain</p>
<p>lay on the north slope, and therefore out of sight from where she was. "looks as bad as any," said</p>
<p>ander?on. "goodby to my money." lenore shut her eyes and thought of herself, her inward state. she seemed calm, and</p>
<p>glad to have that first part of the iourney almost ended. her motive in coming was not now the impelling</p>
<p>thing that had actuated her. when next the car slowed down she heard her father say, "drive in by the</p>
<p>house." then lenore, opening her eyes, saw the gate, the trim little orchard with its scant shade, the gray old</p>
<p>weatherbeaten house which she remembered ?o well. the big porch looked inviting, as it was shady and held an old</p>
<p>rockingchair and a bench with blue cushions. a door stood wide open. no one appeared to be on the premises.</p>
<p>"nash, blow your horn an then hunt around for ?omebody," said ander?on. "come, get out, lenore. you must be half</p>
<p>dead." "oh no. only half dust and half fire," replied lenore, laughing, as she stepped out. what a relief to</p>
<p>get rid of coat, veils, bonnet, and to sit on a shady porch where a faint breeze blew! just at</p>
<p>that instant she heard a low, distant rumbling. thunder! it thrilled her. iake brought her a cold, refreshing drink, and</p>
<p>she sent him back after another. she wet her handkerchief and bathed her hot face. it was indeed very comfortable</p>
<p>there after that long hot ride. "miss lenore, i seen thet nash pawin you," said the cowboy, "an by gosh!</p>
<p>i couldn t believe my eyes!" "not ?o loud! fake, the young gentleman imagines i m in love with him,"</p>
<p>replied lenore. "wall, i ll remove his imagining ," declared iake, coolly. "iake, you will do nothing." "ahuh! then you</p>
<p>air in love with him?" lenore was compelled to explain to this loyal cowboy just what the situation meant. whereupon</p>
<p>iake swore his amaze, and said, "i m agoin to lick him, anyhow, fer thet!" and he caught up the</p>
<p>tin cup and shuffled away. footsteps and voices ?ounded on the path, upon which presently appeared ander?on and young dorn.</p>
<p>"father s gone to wheatly," he was saying. "but i m glad to tell you we ll pay twenty thousand</p>
<p>dollars on the debt as ?oon as we harvest. if it rains we ll pay it all and have thirty</p>
<p>thousand left." "good! i sure hope it rains. an that thunder ."ounds hopeful," responded ander?on. "it s been hopeful like</p>
<p>that for several days, but no rain," said dorn. and then, espying lenore, he seemed startled out of his eagerness.</p>
<p>he flushed slightly. "i-i didn t see-you had brought your daughter." he greeted her ?omewhat bashfully. and lenore returned the</p>
<p>greeting calmly, watching him steadily and waiting for the nameless sensations she had imagined would attend this meeting. but whatever</p>
<p>these might be, they did not come to overwhelm her. the gladness of his voice, as he had spoken ?o</p>
<p>eagerly to her father about the debt, had made her feel very kindly toward him. it might have been natural</p>
<p>for a young man to resent this dragging debt. but he was fine. she observed, as he sat down, that,</p>
<p>once the smile and flush left his face, he seemed ?omewhat thinner and older than she had pictured him. a</p>
<p>shadow lay in his eyes and his lips were sad. he had evidently been working, upon their arrival. he wore</p>
<p>overalls, dusty and ragged," his arms, bare to the elbow, were brown and muscular; his thin cotton shirt was wet</p>
<p>with sweat and it clung to his powerful shoulders. ander?on surveyed the .VOung man with friendly glance. "what s your</p>
<p>first name?" he queried, with his blunt frankness, "kurt," was the reply. "is that american?" "no, neither is dorn. but</p>
<p>kurt dorn is an american." "hum! ?o i see, an i m powerful glad..._ an you ve saved the big</p>
<p>section of promisin wheat?" "yes. we ve been lucky. it s the best and finest wheat father ever raised. if</p>
<p>it rains the yield will go sixty bushels to the acre." "sixty? whew!" eiaculated ander?on. lenore smiled at these wheat</p>
<p>men, and said: "it surely will rain-and likely storm today. i am a prophet who never fails." "by george! that</p>
<p>s true! lenore has anybody beat when it comes to figurin the weather," declared ander?on. dorn looked at her without</p>
<p>speaking, but his smile seemed to say that she could not help being a prophet of good, of hope, of</p>
<p>joy, "say, lenore, how many bushels in a section at sixty per acre?" went on ander?on. "thirtyeight thousand four hundred,"</p>
<p>replied lenore, "an what ll you sell for?" asked ander."on of dorn. "father has ?old at two dollars and twentyfive</p>
<p>cents a bushel," replied darn, "good! but he ought to have waited. the government will set a higher price.___</p>
