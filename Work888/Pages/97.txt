<p>would tell ioe dan that when you die, you cease to exist. one day, a friend of theirs was in</p>
<p>a car accident. both boys were very upset and asked to go to the hospital. as they saw the boy</p>
<p>lying in the bed, bandaged, they both were a little frightened about the reality of him dying. the parents of</p>
<p>the boy were there and very concerned, also. the older brother, who had been driving, had died at the scene.</p>
<p>now, they could only wait to see if their only remaining child would live. mike had taken the boys to</p>
<p>the hospital and had an opportunity to share with the parents and to pray for their son s healing. before</p>
<p>mike left, the parents gave their lives to christ. this meant they were also leaving their only child in his</p>
<p>hands. gene ir. listened to all that was said and had an opportunity to believe then, but chose not to.</p>
<p>when the boy got well and the parents gave all the llory to god, gene /"r. would /"ust comment that,</p>
<p>"it was not a miracle, he just had good doctors." don clarence was the second oldest of gene s boys.</p>
<p>he was always in trouble in school and away from school. ionathan ieremiah was mike s second son, he and</p>
<p>don were just as close as gene /"r. and /"oe dan. they played together all the time, and they also</p>
<p>ate lunch together. when don wanted iohn to do the same bad things that he was doing, iohn drew the</p>
<p>line. he always said that it was sin and he would not sin against god. don spoke just like his</p>
<p>dad. he said, "there is no god and there is nothing called sin. sin is only in the mind of</p>
<p>a person that is insecure." the boys grew further apart as time went on. it seemed they had less and</p>
<p>less in common and iohn did not want to be a bad witness. the next three children that gene and</p>
<p>roxann had were two girls and a boy. the first was daphne, the second was regina and the boy was</p>
<p>butch. both girls were very beautiful when they were babies, as they grew, their beauty increased, which even surprised their</p>
<p>parents. some people said the girls were more beautiful than movie stars. with their beauty, it did not take long</p>
<p>for the boys to notice that both sisters were knockouts. real problems did not occur when the girls first started</p>
<p>to school, but by the second grade, the boys, especially the older boys, were already casting their eyes upon them.</p>
<p>when the girls started the sixth grade, boys were calling every night. also, mother nature started to work on the</p>
<p>girls and by the time they were in the eighth grade, they were developed better than most teens and most</p>
<p>women. as the children grew older and could do things on their own, they started straying further from mike S</p>
<p>kids. their "groups" were not the same anymore. they then began to look for "exciting" things to get away with</p>
<p>or do and spent less and less time at each other s homes, as well as their own home. when</p>
<p>daphne was in the ninth grade, the problems started to get very serious. the high school boys were calling and</p>
<p>taking her out every weekend. sometimes, if she had her home work finished, she was allowed to go out on</p>
<p>the weekdays. she would always rush to complete things whether it was right or not. she wanted to be the</p>
<p>most popular girl in the school and to do that, she must be seen with the "cool" guys. one night,</p>
<p>the telephone rang. gene and daphne picked the phone up at the same time. when he heard daphne say hello,</p>
<p>he was going to put the receiver down, but something told him not to. "oh, hi, ierry! it is so</p>
<p>good to hear from you. i miss you so much!" "daphne, we were just at school together a while ago."</p>
<p>"i know, but ierry, i just love being with you. you are so cool and i would do anything to</p>
<p>be with you all the time," "anything, daphne? how about we take a drive down to the park or if</p>
<p>your parents are going to be gone, maybe we could /"ust stay at your house, and." after he listened to</p>
<p>the boy on the line talking, and he heard daphne tell him that she would do anything, if he would</p>
<p>take her out. anything. gene s stomach dropped to the floor. the very same thing she was telling the boys</p>
<p>was the same thing that girls had said to him when he was in high school. he thought back about</p>
<p>what they "were saying and the things that he would always get from the girls who said that to him.</p>
<p>the lord put a thought into his mind, "/"ust as you were taking advantage of young naive girls in high</p>
<p>school, now it is time for you to see what it is like when the boys do the same thing</p>
<p>to your daughters." the first boy that took her from being a girl to a woman was a senior. he</p>
<p>had taken her out four other times and, each and every time, he said he was in love with her.</p>
<p>on the fifth date, they had parked and started to "make out" for just a little while. as you can</p>
<p>guess, the making out went further and further. when the date was over, she was not a virgin. after three</p>
<p>more dates, she d had her fill of this boy that was so childish. she wanted to date real men,</p>
<p>the kind of guys she was looking for were those that could show a girl a real good time, at</p>
<p>least two or three times a night. in other words, she wanted sex, but sex was not satisfying the void</p>
<p>in her life. she could never put her finger on that void, so she thought the more sex she</p>
