<p>with his prophecies and his theories. "but stupid old epimetheus went working and grubbing on, with the help of his</p>
<p>wife pandora, always looking behind him to see what had happened, till he really learnt to know now and then</p>
<p>what would happen next; and understood so well which side his bread was buttered, and which way the cat iumped,</p>
<p>that he began to make things which would work, and go on working, too; to till and drain the ground,</p>
<p>and to make looms, and ships, and railroads, and steam ploughs, and electric telegraphs, and all the things which you</p>
<p>see in the great exhibition; and to foretell famine, and bad weather, and the price of stocks and {what is</p>
<p>hardest of all) the next vagary of the great idol Whirligig, which some call public opinion; till at last he</p>
<p>grew as rich as a iew, and as fat as a farmer, and people thought twice before they meddled with</p>
<p>him, but only once before they asked him to help them; for, because he earned his money well, he could</p>
<p>afford to spend it well likewise. "and his children are the men of science, who get good lasting work done</p>
<p>in the world." but the children of prometheus are the fanatics, and the theorists, and the bigots, and the bores,</p>
<p>and the noisy windy people, who go telling silly folk what will happen, instead of looking to see what has</p>
<p>happened already." now, was not mother carey s a wonderful story? and, i am happy to say, tom believed it</p>
<p>every word. for so it happened to tom likewise. he was very sorely tried; for though, by keeping the dog</p>
<p>to heels (or rather to toes, for he had to walk backward), he could see pretty well which way the</p>
<p>dog was hunting, yet it was much slower work to go backwards than to go forwards. but, what was more</p>
<p>trying still, no sooner had he got out of peacepool, than there came running to him all the con/"urors, fortune-tellers,</p>
<p>astrologers, prophesiers, proiectors, prestigiators, as many as were in those parts {and there are too many of them everywhere), old</p>
<p>mother shipton on her broomstick, with merlin, thomas the rhymer, gerbertus, rabanus maurus, nostradamus, zadkiel, raphael, moore, old nixon, and</p>
<p>a good many in black coats and white ties who might have known better, considering in what century they were</p>
<p>born, all bawling and screaming at him, "look a-head, only look a-head," and we will show you what man never</p>
<p>saw before, and right away to the end of the world.-" but i am proud to say that, though tom</p>
<p>had not been to cambridge - for, if he had, he would have certainly been senior wrangler - he was</p>
<p>such a little dogged, hard, gnarly, foursquare brick of an english boy, that he never turned his head round once</p>
<p>all the way from peacepool to the other-end-of-nowhere: but kept his eye on the dog, and let him pick out</p>
<p>the scent, hot or cold, straight or crooked, wet or dry, up hill or down dale; by which means he</p>
<p>never made a single mistake, and saw all the wonderful and hitherto by- no-mortal-man-imagined things, which it is my duty</p>
<p>to relate to you in the next chapter. by this time king giglio s aides-de-camp had come up, whom his</p>
<p>ma/"esty ordered to bind the prisoner. and they tied his hands behind him, and bound his legs tight under his</p>
<p>horse, having set him with his face to the tail," and in this fashion he was led back to king</p>
<p>giglio s quarters, and thrust into the very dungeon where young bulbo had been confined. padella (who was a very</p>
<p>different person in the depth of his distress, to padella, the proud wearer of the crim tartar crown}, now most</p>
<p>affectionately and earnestly asked to see his son--his dear eldest boy--his darling bulbo; and that good-natured young man never once</p>
<p>reproached his haughty parent for his unkind conduct the day before, when he would have left bulbo to be shot</p>
<p>without any pity, but came to see his father, and spoke to him through the grating of the door, beyond</p>
<p>which he was not allowed to go." and brought him some sandwiches from the grand supper which his majesty was</p>
<p>giving above stairs, in honour of the brilliant victory which had just been achieved, i cannot stay with you long,</p>
<p>sir, says bulbo, who was in his best ball dress, as he handed his father in the prog, i am</p>
<p>engaged to dance the next quadrille with her maiesty queen rosalba, and i hear the fiddles playing at this very</p>
<p>moment. so bulbo went back to the ball-room and the wretched padella ate his solitary supper in silence and tears.</p>
<p>all was now toy in king giglio s circle. dancing, feasting, fun, illuminations, and iollifications of all sorts ensued. the</p>
<p>people through whose villages they passed were ordered to illuminate their cottages at night, and scatter flowers on the roads</p>
<p>during the day. they were requested, and i promise you they did not like to refuse, to serve the troops</p>
<p>liberally with eatables and wine; besides, the army was enriched by the immense quantity of plunder which was found in</p>
<p>king padella s camp, and taken from his soldiers; who (after they had given up everything} were allowed to fraternise</p>
<p>with the conquerors; and the united forces marched back by easy stages towards king giglio s capital, his royal banner</p>
<p>and that of queen rosalba being carried in front of the troops, hedzoff was made a duke and a fieldmarshal,</p>
<p>smith and /"ones were promoted to be earls: the crim tartar order of the pumpkin and the paflagonian decoration of</p>
<p>the cucumber were freely distributed by their maiesties to the army. queen rosalba wore the paflagonian ribbon of the cucumber</p>
<p>across her riding-habit, whilst king giglio never appeared without the grand cordon of the pumpkin. how the people cheered them</p>
<p>as they rode along side by side! they "Jere pronounced to be the handsomest couple ever seen: that was</p>
