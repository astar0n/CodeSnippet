<p>never stare inquisitively at anyone in the face. his gaze spent greater time fixed on the ground than it did</p>
<p>at the skies. stemming from a supreme character endowed with such haya, never would he use people s mistakes against</p>
<p>them. as conveyed by aisha d, whenever the prophet (pbuh) was delivered with a word he was not fond of,</p>
<p>he would not react by saying: "why is so and so saying these things?" but instead by remarking "why are</p>
<p>some people saying these things?" (abu dawud, adab, 5/4I88) and sometimes, to impart a feeling of dislike for certain inappropriate</p>
<p>behavior, he would caution them in the most sophisticated manner, saying: "why am i seeing such and such things committed?",26</p>
<p>as if to figuratively turn the blame on himself. virtually quivering not to break anyone s heart even when counseling</p>
<p>them, the prophet of excellence fpbuh) was thus a lofty tower of compassion. having imbibed such prophetic morals, mawlana rumi,</p>
<p>that illustrious friend of the truth, swathes abstract realities in concrete words when he says: " what is iman? asked</p>
<p>my reason to my heart, whispering into the ear of my reason, my heart replied, iman is but manners t"adab),"</p>
<p>nowhere seen to give in to fear and anxiety throughout his life, it is inconceivable to even try to imagine</p>
<p>a hero greater than the messenger of allah {pbuh} . patient and persevering in times of extraordinary dread, he would</p>
<p>never act inappropriately, like most tend to do when under the spell of fright. reciting but the two ayah from</p>
<p>session yasin below, he had bravely and indifferently walked through the ranks of those waiting to slay him: "we have</p>
<p>put yokes round their necks right up to their chins, so that their heads are forced up (and they cannot</p>
<p>see}. and we have put a bar in front of them and a bar behind them, and further, we have</p>
<p>covered them up; so that they cannot see," (yasin, 8-I} ali(ra)recounts: "when the battle of badr was continuing with all</p>
<p>its vigor, we were taking refuge behind the messenger of allah tpbuh} . he was by far our bravest,,,he would</p>
<p>always be positioned closest to the enemy ranks." (ahmad, i, 86) a similar report is given by bara d, with</p>
<p>regard to the blessed prophet s (pbuh) courage: "by allah, whenever the battle got fierce, we would seek the shelter</p>
<p>of the messenger of allah tpbuh} . we would regard the next most courageous as he, courageous enough to stand</p>
<p>in the same line as him." (muslim, {pbuh} ihad, II) for i la-i kalimatullah, that is to raise the word</p>
<p>of allah and render his religion the highest, he would always be in the frontline of battle. during the battle</p>
<p>of hunayn, despite the initial disarray of the muslim army, he proved he had lost none of his resolve as</p>
<p>he lunged into the center of the enemy lines, charging his mule further into their core, raising thereby the courage</p>
<p>of his companions, until with divine assistance, they were able to turn the tide and claim victory. (muslim, (pbuh} ihad,</p>
<p>I6-81} he would say: "by allah under whose power and will i abide, i would dearly love to fight for</p>
<p>the sake of allah and be martyred; then be revived to fight once more and be martyred again, and "there</p>
<p>was nobody with more beautiful morals than the messenger of allah tpbuh} . whenever someone from his family or among</p>
<p>his friends called him, he always responded in the politest way. it was owing to his sublime morals that allah,</p>
<p>glory unto him, revealed the verse: and you stand on an exalted standard of character. (al-qalam, 4}" (wahidi, p.463) throughout</p>
<p>his life the noble messenger (pbuh) never sought personal revenge, habitually opting to forgive instead. aisha d, again, elaborates the</p>
<p>gentleness of the morals of the prophet {pbuh} along the following lines: "he never humiliated anyone_,_neither did he respond to</p>
<p>evil except with forgiveness and lenience. he always stood remote from evil. never has he taken personal revenge from anyone,</p>
<p>there is neither a slave nor a servant, even an animal he has handled unjust ly." the words below, reminiscent</p>
<p>of the blessed prophet, belong to anas{ra): "i have never touched a satin or silk softer than the hands of</p>
<p>the messenger of allah {pbuh} . neither have i smelt a fragrance sweeter than his. i served him for exactly</p>
<p>ten years. he was never frustrated with me: not even once did he say phew . not only did he</p>
<p>ever ask why did you do this for something i did, he did not ever remark should not began rebuking</p>
<p>him, until the blessed prophet (pbuh) intervened: "it s best you leave the man alone. just pour a bucket of</p>
<p>water over where he has urinated...for you have been sent to make things easy, not to cause difficulty." he then</p>
<p>benignly explained to the bedouin the importance of mosques and the manners to "i was walking with the messenger of</p>
<p>allah {pbuh} . he was wearing a mantle made of nairan fabric, with thick and rigid edges. a bedouin then</p>
<p>caught up with the prophet of allah {pbuh} and tugged the mantle from behind so forcefully that the edge of</p>
<p>the mantle, as i saw it, became par with his neck. the bedouin then shouted: muhammad! order them to give</p>
<p>me some of what you have with you of the goods that belong to allah! the messenger of allah simply</p>
<p>turned around and smiled at the man, before ensuring he received some goods," fbukhari, khumus 1I, libas 18, adab 68;</p>
<p>muslim, zakat 128) his remarkable success in the call was in fact through the blessings of such magnificent conduct, a</p>
<p>maturity of the prophet (pbuh) described by the almighty as: "allah, glory unto him, the rahman, has mercy for those</p>
<p>who are merciful. show mercy and compassion for those on earth so that you will be shown mercy and compassion</p>
<p>by the profound mercy the messenger of allah (pbuh) was imbued with becomes conspicuous, among other selfless deeds, in</p>
