<p>noise level was so high that it produced pain and disrupted the pilot s concentration. he had drawn up plans</p>
<p>for several possible dampening shields for the gear openings, but the manufacturing section had all but closed down and the</p>
<p>shields remained unbuilt. mike walked into the maintenance section and found only the section chief working. he asked the chief</p>
<p>if he could build the sound shields out of plywood for the next test flight. the chief reported that using</p>
<p>plywood on the space plane seemed inappropriate but mike explained how the shields worked only as sound baffles and were</p>
<p>in a low pressure region. the chief agreed and they build the sound shields out of 2 inch plywood. they</p>
<p>then installed them with simple hardware to the sides of the landing gear so that they partially divided the gear</p>
<p>opening, hopefully preventing the harmonic. the test pilots inspected the installation and shook their heads but agreed to the flight.</p>
<p>the takeoff was normal and the gear came up normally. they accelerated too just below mach 1 and then after</p>
<p>trial maneuvers returned to boeing field for a landing approach. as they slowed to "gear down" speed they unconsciously clenched</p>
<p>their teeth expecting the bowling vibration to set in. they were amazed at the lack of noise and excitedly called</p>
<p>mike at boeing to congratulate him. after landing they taxied back to the hangar, where mike and the maintenance chief</p>
<p>were waiting. as soon as the engines were shut down, mike ran out to inspect the plywood shields. they were</p>
<p>intact and the experiment a success. when administration finally read the test reports, they were in an uproar over the</p>
<p>unorthodox methods mike had used. the labor union was even more upset because of the inappropriate use of management labor</p>
<p>to Construct the sound shields. after mike had listened to the complaints and admonishments he announced, "enough is enough and</p>
<p>i quit." the administrator looked shocked and said, "mike as head proiect engineer you cannot just quit." mike laughed and</p>
<p>left. as mike was leaving the parking lot, he decided to stop at the local watering hole. as usual, several</p>
<p>of the engineering staff were on hand, fortifying themselves for the drive home. the iunior engineers acknowledged mike as he</p>
<p>entered, but instead of ioining their group he sat at a table by himself. mike had a few beers but</p>
<p>found no solace in the alcohol and he decided to leave. as he was leaving, the proiect manager came in</p>
<p>and saw mike. mike wanted to avoid him but he could not leave without passing him. they ended up at</p>
<p>the table together. mike was asked why he had blown up and quit. mike responded, "i had enough b.s. and</p>
<p>figured that it was time for me to make a change." the proiect manager asked him to reconsider saying that</p>
<p>the project really needed his skills and that administration would leave him alone. mike genuinely appreciated the offer but reiected</p>
<p>it. he said, "this proiect is almost done and i need to take some time to figure out what i</p>
<p>want to do. i have not yet taken time to recover from my divorce, which i did not want in</p>
<p>the first place. it was that damn church, which brainwashed tisch into believing that my work was evil, causing her</p>
<p>to divorce me. now is a good time for me to Work on my own life." he was uncertain as</p>
<p>to his future, but he the comet was spied by several university astronomers almost simultaneously. its projected mass and course</p>
<p>were analyzed and debated over the internet with everyone listening. the speed of the comet was not impressive by astronomical</p>
<p>standards but a million kilometers per hour far exceeded human concepts of speed. the proiected course of the comet appeared</p>
<p>to intersect the orbit of mars, thereby threatening a collision with mars. when asked, the visitor replied that the thin</p>
<p>atmosphere of mars would be used as a breaking mechanism. the reduced gravity would hopefully not tear the comet apart</p>
<p>as would braking around iupiter. the sling effect would redirect the comet and modify the course so that the comet</p>
<p>would be trap!"-Nd into earth s gravitational well and enter earth orbit. from first sighting it was a few months</p>
<p>before the comet approached mars. the space telescopes were not needed to appreciate the comet s interaction with mars. for</p>
<p>a very 5hort time mars glowed as a miniature red sun. the direct effect on mars was to create tremendous</p>
<p>storms with the red dust clouds obscuring the planet surface. rain fell on the surface of mars for the first</p>
<p>time in many millennium. the orbit wobbled slightly with the contact, but stayed stable. the comet survived the encounter, but</p>
<p>was noticeably smaller following the interaction. the lost mass contributed directly to the atmosphere of mars. the comet was now</p>
<p>heading directly toward earth. the hairy comma surrounding the nucleus visually enlarged the head of the comet with the elongated</p>
<p>tail pointing away from the solar wind. the tail was very dense following the mars interaction, but the nucleus gradually</p>
<p>reclaimed much of the mass which had been torn free. the comet was visibly smaller. the maiority of the change</p>
<p>was due to the loss of the comma during the breaking maneuver; the friction stripped the nucleus of all surface</p>
<p>materials. the sight of the comet approaching earth created a revival of the end of the world scenario. the visitor</p>
<p>was careful to explain the traiectory ghanges that were required to insure proper orbit. the minimal change would require significant</p>
<p>force and the visitor gave the u.n. the choice to make the changes using a small nuclear weapon or to</p>
<p>allow it to make the change. after significant debate the assembly requested that the visitor take responsibility for the trajectory</p>
<p>corrections. the visitor accepted the responsibility and dispatched a small rocket that met the comet half way to earth. the</p>
<p>explosion was witnessed by the space telescopes, but could not be seen from earth. the resulting change in traiectory</p>
