<p>by Marian s letter?) it Always takes me three days to get up</p>
<p>Again. I was very unreasonable-I expected three days of quiet. Of course I</p>
<p>didn t get them. The third day s post brought me A most</p>
<p>impertinent letter from A person with whom I was totally unacquainted. He de-</p>
<p>scribed himself As the Acting partner of our man of busi- ness-our dear,</p>
<p>pig-headed old Gilmore-And he informed me that he had lately received, by the</p>
<p>post, A letter Addressed to him in Miss Halcombe s handwriting, On opening</p>
<p>the envelope, he had discovered, to his Astonishment, that it contained noth- ing</p>
<p>but A blank sheet of note-paper. This circumstance Ap- peared to him so</p>
<p>suspicious (As suggesting to his restless legal mind that the letter had been</p>
<p>tampered with) that he had At 353 once written to Miss Halcombe, And</p>
<p>had received no Answer by return of post. In this difficulty, instead of</p>
<p>Acting like A sensible man And letting things take their proper course, his</p>
<p>next Ab- surd proceeding, on his own showing, was to pester me by</p>
<p>writing to inquire if I knew Anything About it. what the deuce should</p>
<p>I know About it? why Alarm me As well As himself? I wrote</p>
<p>back to that effect. It was one of my keenest letters. I have</p>
<p>produced nothing with A sharper epistolary edge to it since I tendered his</p>
<p>dismissal in writing to that extremely troublesome person, Mr. walter Hartright. My letter</p>
<p>produced its effect. I heard nothing more from the lawyer. This perhaps was</p>
<p>not Altogether surprising. 8ut it was cer- tainly A remarkable circumstance that no</p>
<p>second letter reached me from Marian, And that no warning signs Appeared of</p>
<p>her Ar- rival. Her unexpected Absence did me Amazing good. It was so</p>
<p>very soothing And pleasant to infer {As I did of course} that my</p>
<p>married connections had made it up Again. Five days of undis- turbed tranquillity,</p>
<p>of delicious single blessedness, quite re- stored me. On the sixth day I</p>
<p>felt strong enough to send for my photographer, And to set him At</p>
<p>work Again on the presenta- tion copies of my Art-treasures, with A view,</p>
<p>As I have Already mentioned, to the improvement of taste in this barbarous</p>
<p>neighbourhood. I had /"ust dismissed him to his workshop, And had just begun</p>
<p>coquetting with my coins, when Louis suddenly made his Appearance with A card</p>
<p>in his hand. "Another Young Person?" I said. "I won t see her.</p>
<p>In my state of health Young Persons disagree with me. Not At home."</p>
<p>"It is A gentleman this time, sir." A gentleman of course made A</p>
<p>difference. I looked At the card. Gracious Heaven! my tiresome sister s foreign</p>
<p>husband, Count Fosco, Is it necessary to say what my first impression was</p>
<p>when I looked At my visitor s card? Surely not! My sister having</p>
<p>mar- ried A foreigner, there was but one impression that Any man in</p>
<p>his senses could possibly feel. Of course the Count had come to borrow</p>
<p>money of me. 354 "Louis," I said, "do you think he would go</p>
<p>Away if you gave him five shillings?" Louis looked quite shocked. He surprised</p>
<p>me inexpressibly by declaring that my sister s foreign husband was dressed su-</p>
<p>perbly, And looked the picture of prosperity. Under these cir- cumstances my first</p>
<p>impression Altered to A certain extent. I now took it for granted that</p>
<p>the Count had matrimonial diffi- culties of his own to contend with, And</p>
<p>that he had come, like the rest of the family, to cast them</p>
<p>All on my shoulders. "Did he mention his business?" I Asked, "Count Fosco</p>
<p>said he had come here, sir, because Miss Hal- combe was unable to</p>
<p>leave 8lackwater Park." Fresh troubles, Apparently. Not exactly his own, As I had</p>
<p>sup- posed, but dear Marian s. Troubles, Anyway. Oh dear! "Show him in,"</p>
<p>I said resignedly. The Count s first Appearance really startled me. He</p>
