<p>as we do that of our distant forbears. "it is wonderful what these people did with their rude implements and their limited appliances!" that is what they will</p>
<p>say when they read of our explorations, our voyages, and our wars. now, take that first book on my travel shelf. it is knight s "cruise of the</p>
<p>falcon." nature was guilty of the pun which put this soul into a body so named. read this simple record and tell me if there is anything in</p>
<p>hakluyt more wonderful. two landsmen---solicitors, if i remember right---go down to southampton quay. they pick up a long-shore youth, and they embark in a tiny boat in which</p>
<p>they put to sea. where do they turn up? at buenos ayres. thence they penetrate to paraquay, return to the west indies, sell their little boat there, and</p>
<p>so home. what could the elizabethan mariners have done more? there are no spanish galleons now to vary the monotony of such a voyage, but had there been</p>
<p>i am very certain our adventurers would have had their share of the doubloons. but surely it was the nobler when done out of the pure lust of</p>
<p>adventure and in answer to the call of the sea, with no golden bait to draw them on. the old spirit still lives, disguise it as you will</p>
<p>with top hats, frock coats, and all prosaic settings. perhaps even they also will seem romantic when centuries have blurred them. another book which shows the romance and</p>
<p>the heroism which still linger upon earth is that large copy of the "voyage of the discovery in the antarctic" by captain scott. written in plain sailor fashion</p>
<p>with no attempt at over-statement or colour, it none the less (or perhaps all the more) leaves a deep impression upon the mind. as one reads it, and</p>
<p>reflects on what one reads, one seems to get a clear view of /"ust those qualities which make the best kind of briton. every nation produces brave men.</p>
<p>every nation has men of energy. but there is a certain type which mixes its bravery and its energy with a gentle modesty and a boyish good-humour, and</p>
<p>it is just this type which is the highest, here the whole expedition seem to have been imbued with the spirit of their commander. no flinching, no grumbling,</p>
<p>every discomfort taken as a test, no thought of self, each working only for the success of the enterprise, when you have read of such privations so endured</p>
<p>and so chronicled, it makes one ashamed to show emotion over the small annoyances of daily life. read of scott s blinded, scurvy-struck party staggering on to their</p>
<p>goal, and then complain, if you can, of the heat of a northern sun, or the dust of a country road. that is one of the weaknesses of</p>
<p>modern life. we complain too much. we are not ashamed of complaining, time was when it was otherwise---when it was thought effeminate to complain, the gentleman should always</p>
<p>be the"stoic, with his soul too great to be affected by the small troubles of life. "you look cold, sir," said an english sympathizer to a french</p>
<p>emigre. the fallen noble drew himself up in his threadbare coat, "sir," said he, "a gentleman is never cold," one s consideration for others as well as one</p>
<p>s own self-respect should check the grumble. this self-suppression, and also the concealment of pain are two of the old noblesse oblige characteristics which are now little more</p>
<p>than a tradition. public opinion should be firmer on the matter. the man who must hop because his shin is hacked, or wring his hand because his knuckles</p>
<p>are bruised should be made to feel that he is an object not of pity, but of contempt. the tradition of arctic exploration is a noble one among</p>
<p>americans as well as ourselves. the next book is a case in point. it is greely s "arctic service," and it is a worthy shelf-companion to scott s</p>
<p>"account of the voyage of the discovery." there are incidents in this book which one can never forget, the episode of those twenty-odd men lying upon that horrible</p>
<p>bluff, and dying one a day from cold and hunger and scurvy, is one which dwarfs all our puny tragedies of romance. and the gallant starving leader giving</p>
<p>lectures on abstract science in an attempt to take the thoughts of the dying men away from their sufferings---what a picture! it is bad to suffer from cold</p>
<p>and bad to suffer from hunger, and bad to live in the dark; but that men could do all these things for six months on end, and that</p>
<p>some should live to tell the tale, is, indeed, a marvel. what a World of feeling lies in the exclamation of the poor dying lieutenant: "well, this is</p>
<p>wretched," he groaned, as he turned his face to the wall. the anglo-celtic race has always run to individualism, and yet there is none which is capable of</p>
<p>conceiving and carrying out a finer ideal of discipline. there is nothing in roman or grecian annals, not even the lava-baked sentry at pompeii, which gives a</p>
