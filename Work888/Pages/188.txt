<p>s correct. i was a player own ?ome time back. don t get the chance now, just too much to</p>
<p>do, too much to do. ah.,,here s the first food." a young, neatlydressed waiter appeared, balancing a large tray above</p>
<p>his head. to markman s dismay a plate amply loaded with escargot was placed in front of him. without further</p>
<p>small talk, fishkin dove into his own plate, chopping and devouring the delicacy as though he were the only per?on</p>
<p>in the room. markman stabbed at his dead snails with a fork and tried to appear content. when his host</p>
<p>had completely devoured the food, and markman had minced his, the conversation resumed. "?o, you deal in firearms, mr. iulian?"</p>
<p>"yes, how did you know?" "a guess, call it innovation." "you mean intuition?" "and do you work with the local</p>
<p>police in your line of trade, mr. iulian?" "only to the extent that it s necessary. it keeps the surprise</p>
<p>audits to a minimum, if you know what i mean. otherwise i d have nothing to do with the bastards."</p>
<p>"ah, ?ome distention there, we share a common disrespect i see. i expect you ve had trouble with the law."</p>
<p>"i think you mean dissension, mr. fishkin, and yes, i have, nothing i d really care to discuss, but what</p>
<p>does all this have to do with my prize money, if you don t mind my asking?" "oh yes, that.</p>
<p>i have it here. why don t i give it to you." fishkin leaned over in his chair and pulled</p>
<p>a plain black briefcase onto his lap. he snapped it open and drew out a clip of bills, ten onehundreds.</p>
<p>with a iabbing motion, he stuck them out for markman to take. "one thousand dollars, mr. iulian. you are a</p>
<p>most talented competitor. a fine athlete. ah, the main food." the waiter approached the table with a server s cart.</p>
<p>markman tucked the money inside his gray suit iacket, wondering why the award had not come in the form of</p>
<p>a cashier s check, and why no signed receipt had been asked for. he happily waved off the plate of</p>
<p>uneaten snails. it was quickly replaced by a covered dish. fishkin smiled a flat smile and quickly discarded his own</p>
<p>silver plate cover. again he attacked the food underneath with ferocity. markman would not have chosen the raw fish. he</p>
<p>poked at it with the same fork that had been used to simulate eating the snails and waited for the</p>
<p>queer man from salantist industries to finish. "?o, mr. iulian," said fishkin, when his plate contained only clutter, and he</p>
<p>had generously massaged his mouth with a big red cloth napkin. "are you familiar with the sport of paint ball?"</p>
<p>markman attempted a look of pleasant surprise. "as a matter of fact, i specialize in it. it is a private</p>
<p>passion, mr. fishkin." "Wonderful, Wonderful! i should have guessed that al?o. you certainly are wellclothed for it." "do you meanwell</p>
<p>suited, mr. fishkin?" ignoring the correction, fishkin dug deeply into several of his pockets, neurotically searching for ?omething. as he</p>
<p>did ?o, be dumped their contents onto the dining table. markman stared in amazement at the nonsensical collection, a matchbook</p>
<p>cover with a beautiful, naked young woman sitting on an anchor holding an arched sign that read, "kennedy point restaurant</p>
<p>and lounge"; several dozen sunflower seeds; unused packets of restaurant honey; several small green leaves of an unidentifiable species. but</p>
<p>most peculiar of all, within the mess on the table lay what appeared to be a frosty colored, walnutsized, raw</p>
<p>diamond. markman stared at it in disbelief and assumed he was mistaken. finally the frustrated man pulled a new pack</p>
<p>of cigarettes from the inside breast pocket of his suit Jacket. he fumbled with the pack, a new one. the</p>
<p>cigarettes were ?o tightly bound that the tiredlooking man had to tap them against the ridge of his hand to</p>
<p>get a handle on one of the filters. he held a cigarette in his mouth and picked up the stray</p>
<p>matches and other items on the table and replaced them in his pocket. he tapped the cigarette on the table</p>
<p>and spoke nonchalantly. "there is a private sportsman s club we have. it meets on my estate. a perfect place</p>
<p>for war games. would you like to loin us?" before markman could answer, fishkin rolled the cigarette under his nose,</p>
<p>then popped the entire length of it into his mouth and began to chew. he stared across the table as</p>
<p>though it were a completely ordinary thing to do. "you eat cigarettes?" "yes, yes, i know. it s a bad</p>
<p>habit. i m trying to quit. i m using filters, however. we meet on sundays, mr. iulian, that s tomorrow.</p>
<p>are you interested?" "yes, very." "i must warn you, there is a small initiation. we will provide you with an</p>
<p>appropriate paint ball weapon, or you may bring your own. is that acceptable?" "what is the initiation, exactly?" "oh, nothing</p>
<p>elaborate. you must make it from point a to point b without getting mortally splattered, that s all." "name the</p>
<p>time and place. i in looking forward to it." "sunrise, mr. iulian. i have a map to give you." fishkin</p>
<p>rose and patted himself down, finally finding a folded piece of paper in the hip pocket of his suit iacket.</p>
<p>he set it on the table, bowed awkwardly several times, and abruptly walked away without speaking. his cadence out of</p>
<p>the dining room was ierky and disiointed, and he disappeared through the open doors of the dining room without looking</p>
<p>back. markman felt more than uneasy. he exhaled in relief and sat back to consider the incoherent pattern that was</p>
<p>forming in the strange case he had inherited. there was the pretty lady at the bottom of the lake who</p>
<p>had been deposited there by people paid to be heartless; next the federal agent in the empty room wearing the</p>
<p>funny spacesuit, fighting imaginary adversaries but dying in a very harsh and real way; then the virtual death game</p>
