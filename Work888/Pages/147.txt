<p>after almost three days of flying a round robin and coming home with a surprise package of dope smugglers. "don</p>
<p>t answer that. it was rhetorical. still can t pin down a closer date?" "no. tomi is sticking to the</p>
<p>tenth, but cheryl and the doctor are saying any day now, before the tenth." "bob hasn t been able to</p>
<p>get an answer from the squadron on a schedule for you?" "they keep stalling. i think that they want the</p>
<p>baby to show up quick and they ll get out of making a decision. not that it s a big</p>
<p>deal. we ve already flown more hours than any other kc on the base." "hopefully he ll have an answer</p>
<p>when we get on the ground." rick moved down to the starbread over wing hatch and through its tiny window</p>
<p>watched the east china sea s colors change from a deep blue to a greenish blue then the foamy white</p>
<p>breakers hitting the golden sand beaches of okinawa. the tanker s pilot leveled her wings and continued their descent towards</p>
<p>the runway as the breakers disappeared under the leading edge of the right wing. "you know leo, i always love</p>
<p>flying into this island and landing on 5. watching the sea change colors and the breakers foaming against the beaches,</p>
<p>seeing the small villages amongst the green trees and red roads meandering around the fields of sugar cane and under</p>
<p>the trees. it s really terrible what we re doing to this beautiful island. thousands of acres of farmland and</p>
<p>lush green foliage being bulldozed and paved over so we can put more explosives and hydrocarbon gulping trucks and airplanes</p>
<p>here." "letting a little sentimental and philosophical aren t we?" "yeah, i guess so. i really love this island and</p>
<p>it s people." rick grew quiet and leo went back to his seat in the cargo compartment getting ready for</p>
<p>landing. he continued to gaze out the tiny window and flexed his knees to keep his balance just before the</p>
<p>mains screech down on the concrete. bob kruse met them on the ramp as they closed up 3653 and gathered</p>
<p>up their flight gear. "who are your friends? they said you had special passengers abread but i didn t expect</p>
<p>them to have armed escorts. kind of got suspicious though when they said the aps would bread as soon as</p>
<p>we got the stairs in place before the rest of the geese were offloaded." "just a couple of low grade</p>
<p>drug dealers from the little iohn site at white beach, thought they would make the big time before going back</p>
<p>to conus." leo answered. "i have good news and bad news. which do you want, rick? none of it is</p>
<p>terrible, but it s the best that the first sergeant and i could do for you and tomi. "go ahead.</p>
<p>it can t be too awful bad by the look on your face and the fact that cheryl isn t</p>
<p>here raising hell with the whole air force says so," "the squadron commander thinks it s a fairchild issue and</p>
<p>that we should have gone to them. but in the end he compromised. i think that he got some pressure</p>
<p>from a couple of flight crews that i happened to talk to while you guys were gallivanting all over the</p>
<p>pacific ocean." "we ll travel night an day till we reach the old man an have him send the bones</p>
<p>back. i hate to do it, but we have no choice. anyhow, we might as well be hanged for stealin</p>
<p>a horse as for anything else." they topped a hill and came face to face with a rider traveling town</p>
<p>ward, his gaze took in the animals carrying the fugitives and iumped to the face of billie. in the eyes</p>
<p>of the man was an expression blended of suspicion and surprise. he passed with a nod and a surly "</p>
<p>evenin ." "fine luck we re havin , billie," commented his friend with a little laugh. "i give sanders twenty</p>
<p>minutes to be on our trail." through the gathering darkness prince watched the figure of his companion droop. the slim,</p>
<p>lithe body sagged and the shoulders were heavy with exhaustion. both small hands clung to the pommel of the saddle.</p>
<p>it took no prophet to see that in his present condition the wounded man would never travel the gun-barrel road</p>
<p>as far as the dust of the flying v y herd. even by easy stages he could not do it,</p>
<p>and with pursuit thundering at their heels the ride would be a cruel, grilling one. "how about pullin a little</p>
<p>strategy on sanders, iim? instead of hittin the long trail, let s circle back around the town, strike the river,</p>
<p>make camp, an lie low in the chaparral. does that listen good to you?" young clanton looked at his friend</p>
<p>suspiciously. the .VQunger man was fagged out and in a good deal of pain. the iolting of the pony s</p>
<p>movements /arred the bandages on the wound. already his fever was high and he had moments of light-headedness. he knew</p>
<p>that his partner was proposing to ieopardize his own chances of escape in order to take care of him. "no</p>
<p>sir. we ll keep goin right ahead," he said irritably. "think i m a quitter? think i m goin to</p>
<p>lie down on you?" "would i be likely to think that?" asked billie gently. "what i m thinking is that</p>
<p>both of us would be better for a good night s rest. why not throw off an camp in the</p>
<p>darkness? while we re sleepin sanders an his posse will be ridin the hearts out of their horses. it looks</p>
<p>like good business to me to let em go to it." "no," said iim obstinately. "no. we ll keep ridin</p>
<p>." prince knew that the other understood what he was trying to do, and that his pride--and perhaps something better</p>
<p>than pride--would not accept such a sacrifice, billie said no more, but his mind still wrestled with the problem</p>
<p>I</p>
