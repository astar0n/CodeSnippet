<p>build assurance. because of the limits of our linear existence, repetition, for all of its tendency to stray from the</p>
<p>true visionary message, cannot be dispensed with. and patience is the virtue that should be greatly sought after, from this</p>
<p>most eternal of all sources. only time itself will tell if we are able to choose the best from among</p>
<p>all the rest! but history repeats itself as a testimony of our imperfection. and trying is all that we have,</p>
<p>to perceive if our way is the path that has been shown to us. so, maybe a name isn t</p>
<p>afterword i had intended that god in the "dialogue" would have had the last word in this rather voluminous essay,</p>
<p>or assay as the dictionary might better describe it, "to examine by trial." but alas the very smallness of man</p>
<p>compared to his ego cannot resist having one more. i had become aware, some time after i felt that i</p>
<p>had finally completed my assignment, that there was something still missing. had it been something still left unsaid." some point</p>
<p>of incompleteness? something missed in translation from the most comprehensive of all sources down to the very best that man</p>
<p>can manage." then an idea came to me and it wouldn t let go. so an "epiphany" followed the "dialogue."</p>
<p>that still didn t seem to relieve the pressure totally and so this "afterword" now has to be engaged. while</p>
<p>i may feel more comfortable placing myself closer to the lesser end in the scale of human resourcefulness, i have</p>
<p>tried to write about the frustration of those who have had a vision, where they have had to try to</p>
<p>squeeze such grandiloquence into the narrowness of man s linguistics, only to discover for myself this feeling, up close and</p>
<p>personal, so once again i will try to conclude that which probably Cannot come to a conclusion within man 5</p>
<p>range of understanding. have there been any inferences not at least alluded to, or maybe too subtly drawn to have</p>
<p>been perceived in the ordinariness of this author s mental repertoire." at the risk of repetition, i shall endeavor to</p>
<p>list some that have come to mind during my own elucidation. first, there is that presence that seems to have</p>
<p>always hovered in and over this creation. what, if anything, preceded man s attempt to envision some essence, before a</p>
<p>first "animal spirit" presence, is at this juncture, unassailably beyond common memory, and possibly discovery, the spiral up through the</p>
<p>higher levels of climatological iconography, then geological, astronomical, universal and beyond has seemed to have only added confusion to complexity</p>
<p>at the expense of a clarity so diligently sought after. man s use of elaboration in his attempt to clarify</p>
<p>what was almost impossible to translate into his human vernacular have many times so smohureed any original revelation as to</p>
<p>have hidden what was meant to have been opened. within the ages of generations the popularity of these ever-less-meaningful elaborations</p>
<p>have declined to the point of having dropped into a fog of forgetfulness, with only pitifully minute traces left to</p>
<p>mark their passing. but this presence has been persistently forgiving of the well-intentioned fagades erected that only served to diminish</p>
<p>the light of each of these kernels of brilliance. the lack of permanence of these man-made edifices is only too</p>
<p>well documented, and man s teleological rubble appears to hide these many pearls of perception from our after-view. but all</p>
<p>must not be seen as lost! what might be able to be resurrected? through the gleanings of the many ways</p>
<p>that direct man s inquisitive search for his roots, these gems of cognition might still be regained, to shine again</p>
<p>as they once did with the eternal brilliance they were intended to reflect. but that presence carries on, continuing to</p>
<p>encourage the insight which would pierce that fog of man-made representations. it has already been a god-awfully long wait! my</p>
<p>second conclusion is that belief always arrives before proof, many times ages before. the belief that something works to one</p>
<p>s advantage before the knowledge of why it does is the sharp-edged tool that has most certainly enhanced man s</p>
<p>long-term survival. it has been what has made him different from all who have shared his cradle of infancy, the</p>
<p>nature from out of which he has apparently arisingn. but it has come at a cost. many have been led</p>
<p>astray by less than a well-founded belief that has seemed to work for a while, only to betray the trust</p>
<p>placed in it, as over the long haul it failed to deliver what was touted for it. that seems to</p>
<p>be why something more surely effective has always been sought as an adjunct to it, where man has become practiced</p>
<p>in the memory of an advantage that belief has many times bestowed, he has thrived in the good times and</p>
<p>survived the bad. he has persisted throughout the tribulations that have driven ohures to extinction. but any system of belief</p>
<p>is only as good as its basis. that original basis seems to have been experience. as it was tried and</p>
<p>found to be experientially true, the urge to pass it on to ohures became important. one s own family and</p>
<p>progeny might depend on it; one s hunting group might be able to bring home the bacon because of it.</p>
<p>one s own community might learn to thrive because of it, even to survive because of it, and so on</p>
<p>toward that, which this arrow of progress seems to have pointed, to civilization and all its complex interweavings. but experience</p>
<p>is a sometimes brutal taskmaster also, and so, if only a way to learn before the doing could be found.</p>
<p>voila! language! the lowest form of grunt communication that could pass on that which was most necessary seems to have,</p>
<p>over a plethora of a great many generations of time, reached up to become the flowering of today s complicated</p>
<p>linguistics. the story of the tower of babel is an excellent example, a kind of parable, of the progression</p>
