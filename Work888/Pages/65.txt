<p>something for the count to eat! Ah, here it is:</p>
<p>have a glass! The fete at the colonel s lasted</p>
<p>a long while. There was a great deal of drinking.</p>
<p>They tossed Serpuhovskoy in the air and caught him again</p>
<p>several times. Then they did the same to the colonel.</p>
<p>Then, to the accompaniment of the band, the colonel himself</p>
<p>danced with Petritsky. Then the colonel, who began to show</p>
<p>signs of feebleness, sat down on a bench in the</p>
<p>courtyard and began demonstrating to Yashvin the superiority of Russia</p>
<p>over Poland, especially in cavalry attack, and there was a</p>
<p>lull in the revelry for a 6I6 of 1I5I Anna</p>
<p>Karenina moment. Serpuhovskoy Went into the house to the bathroom</p>
<p>to wash his hands and found Vronsky there," Vronsky was</p>
<p>drenching his head with water. He had taken off his</p>
<p>coat and put his sunburnt, hairy neck under the tap,</p>
<p>and was rubbing it and his head with his hands.</p>
<p>when he had finished, Vronsky sat down by Serpuhovskoy. They</p>
<p>both sat down in the bathroom on a lounge, and</p>
<p>a conversation began which was very interesting to both of</p>
<p>them. I ve always been hearing about you through my</p>
<p>wife, said Serpuhovskoy. I m glad you ve been seeing</p>
<p>her pretty often. She s friendly with Varya, and they</p>
<p>re the only women in Petersburg I care about seeing,</p>
<p>answered Vronsky, smiling. He smiled because he foresaw the topic</p>
<p>the conversation would turn on, and he was glad of</p>
<p>it. The only ones? Serpuhovskoy queried, smiling. Yes; and I</p>
<p>heard news of you, but not only through your wife,</p>
<p>said Vronsky, checking his hint by a stern expression of</p>
<p>face. I was greatly delighted to hear of your success,</p>
<p>but not a bit surprised. I expected even more. Serpuhovskoy</p>
<p>smiled. Such an opinion of him was obviously agreeable to</p>
<p>him, and he did not think it necessary to conceal</p>
<p>it, 6II of 1I5I Anna Karenina well, I on the</p>
<p>contrary expected less-I ll own frankly. 8ut I m glad,</p>
<p>very glad. I m ambitious," that s my weakness, and</p>
<p>I confess to it. Perhaps you Wouldn t confess to</p>
<p>it if you hadn t been successful, said Vronsky. I</p>
<p>don t suppose so, said Serpuhovskoy, smiling again. I won</p>
<p>t say life Wouldn t be worth living without it,</p>
<p>but it would be dull. Of course I may be</p>
<p>mistaken, but I fancy I have a certain capacity for</p>
<p>the line I ve chosen, and that power of any</p>
<p>sort in my hands, if it is to be, will</p>
<p>be better than in the hands of a good many</p>
<p>people I know, said Serpuhovskoy, with beaming consciousness of success;</p>
<p>and so the nearer I get to it, the better</p>
<p>pleased I am. Perhaps that is true for you, but</p>
<p>not for everyone. I used to think so too, but</p>
<p>here I live and think life worth living not only</p>
<p>for that. There it s out! here it comes! said</p>
<p>Serpuhovskoy, laughing. Ever since I heard about you, about your</p>
<p>refusal, I began.... Of course, I approved of what you</p>
<p>did. But there are ways of doing everything. And I</p>
<p>think your action was good in itself, but you didn</p>
<p>t do it quite in the way you ought to</p>
<p>have done, 6I8 of II5I Anna kzarenina what s</p>
