something for the count to eat! Ah, here it is:
have a glass! The fete at the colonel s lasted
a long while. There was a great deal of drinking.
They tossed Serpuhovskoy in the air and caught him again
several times. Then they did the same to the colonel.
Then, to the accompaniment of the band, the colonel himself
danced with Petritsky. Then the colonel, who began to show
signs of feebleness, sat down on a bench in the
courtyard and began demonstrating to Yashvin the superiority of Russia
over Poland, especially in cavalry attack, and there was a
lull in the revelry for a 6I6 of 1I5I Anna
Karenina moment. Serpuhovskoy Went into the house to the bathroom
to wash his hands and found Vronsky there," Vronsky was
drenching his head with water. He had taken off his
coat and put his sunburnt, hairy neck under the tap,
and was rubbing it and his head with his hands.
when he had finished, Vronsky sat down by Serpuhovskoy. They
both sat down in the bathroom on a lounge, and
a conversation began which was very interesting to both of
them. I ve always been hearing about you through my
wife, said Serpuhovskoy. I m glad you ve been seeing
her pretty often. She s friendly with Varya, and they

it. The only ones? Serpuhovskoy queried, smiling. Yes; and I

contrary expected less-I ll own frankly. 8ut I m glad,
very glad. I m ambitious," that s my weakness, and
I confess to it. Perhaps you Wouldn t confess to
it if you hadn t been successful, said Vronsky. I
don t suppose so, said Serpuhovskoy, smiling again. I won
t say life Wouldn t be worth living without it,
but it would be dull. Of course I may be

the line I ve chosen, and that power of any
sort in my hands, if it is to be, will
be better than in the hands of a good many
people I know, said Serpuhovskoy, with beaming consciousness of success;
and so the nearer I get to it, the better
pleased I am. Perhaps that is true for you, but
not for everyone. I used to think so too, but
here I live and think life worth living not only
for that. There it s out! here it comes! said
Serpuhovskoy, laughing. Ever since I heard about you, about your
refusal, I began.... Of course, I approved of what you
did. But there are ways of doing everything. And I
