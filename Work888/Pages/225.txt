<p>rose into a shriek as he ended, for a shovel-headed spear had been buried in his chest. a second wave of dervishes lapped over the hillocks, and burst</p>
<p>upon the machine-gun and the right front of the line. the sailors were overborne in an instant, but the mallows, with their fighting blood aflame, met the yell</p>
<p>of the moslem with an even wilder, fiercer cry, and dropped two hundred of them with a single point-blank volley. the howling, leaping crew swerved away to the</p>
<p>right, and dashed on into the gap which had already been made for them. but c company had drawn no trigger to stop that fiery rush. the men</p>
<p>leaned moodily upon their martinis. some had even thrown them upon the ground. conolly was talking fiercely to those about him. captain foley, thrusting his way through the</p>
<p>press, rushed up to him with a revolver in his hand. "this is your doing, you villain!" he cried. "if you raise your pistol, captin, your brains will</p>
<p>be over your coat," said a low voice at his side. he saw that several rifles were turned on him. the two subs. had pressed forward, and were</p>
<p>by his side. "what is it, then?" he cried, looking round from one fierce mutinous face to another. "are you irishmen? are you soldiers? what are you here</p>
<p>for but to fight for your country?" "england is no country of ours," cried several. "you are not fighting for england. you are fighting for ireland, and for</p>
<p>the empire of which it as part." "a black curse on the impire!" shouted private mcquire, throwing down his rifle. " twas the impire that backed the man</p>
<p>that druv me onto the roadside. may me hand stiffen before i draw trigger for it. "what s the impire to us, captain foley, and what s the</p>
<p>widdy to us ayther?" cried a voice. "let the constabulary foight for her." "ay, be god, they d be better imployed than pullin a poor man s thatch</p>
<p>about his ears." "or shootin his brother, as they did mine." "it was the impire laid my groanin mother by the wayside. her son will rot before he</p>
<p>upholds it, and ye can put that in the charge-sheet in the next coort-martial." in vain the three officers begged, menaced, persuaded. the square was still moving, ever</p>
<p>moving, with the same bloody fight raging in its entrails. even while they had been speaking they had been shuffling backwards, and the useless gardner, with her slaughtered</p>
<p>crew, was already a good hundred yards from them. and the pace was accelerating. the mass of men, tormented and writhing, was trying, by a common instinct, to</p>
<p>reach some clearer ground where they could re-form. three faces were still intact, but the fourth had been caved in, and badly mauled, without its comrades being able</p>
<p>to help it. the guards had met a fresh rush of the hadendowas, and had blown back the tribesmen with a volley, and the cavalry had ridden over</p>
<p>another stream of them, as they welled out of the gully. a litter of hamstrung horses, and haggled men behind them, showed that a spearman on his face</p>
<p>among the bushes can show some sport to the man who charges him. but, in spite of all, the square was still reeling swiftly backwards, trying to shake</p>
<p>itself clear of this torment which clung to its heart. would it break or would it re-form? the lives of five regiments and the honour of the flag</p>
<p>hung upon the answer. some, at least, were breaking. the c company of the mallows had lost all military order, and was pushing back in spite of the</p>
<p>haggard officers, who cursed, and shoved, and prayed in the vain attempt to hold them. the captain and the subs. were elbowed and iostled, while the men crowded</p>
<p>towards private conolly for their orders. the confusion had not spread, for the other companies, in the dust and smoke and turmoil, had lost touch with their mutinous</p>
<p>comrades. captain foley saw that even now there might be time to avert a disaster. "think what you are doing, man," he yelled, rushing towards the ringleader. "there</p>
<p>are a thousand irish in the square, and they are dead men if we break." the words alone might have had little effect on the old moonlighter. it</p>
<p>is possible that, in his scheming brain, he had already planned how he was to club his irish together and lead them to the sea. but at that</p>
<p>moment the arabs broke through the screen of camels which had fended them off. there was a struggle, a screaming, a mule rolled over, a wounded man sprang</p>
<p>up in a cacolet with a spear through him, and then through the narrow gap surged a stream of naked savages, mad with battle, drunk with slaughter, spotted</p>
<p>and splashed with blood -- blood dripping from their spears, their arms, their faces. their yells, their bounds, their crouching, darting figures, the horrid energy of their spear-thrusts,</p>
<p>made them look like a blast of fiends from the pit. and were these the allies of ireland." were these the men who were to strike for</p>
