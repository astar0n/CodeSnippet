<p>has been lying in wait. she recoiled with a gasp, but she could not run away. she was caught as</p>
<p>surely as she had been the night before. "hullo!" smiled sir eustace, with extended hand. "going out for a last</p>
<p>look round? may i come too?" she felt the dominance of his grip. it was coolly, imperially possessive. to answer</p>
<p>his request seemed superfluous, even bordering upon presumption. it was obvious that he had every intention of accompanying her. she</p>
<p>gave a confused murmur of assent, and they passed through the vestibule side by side. she was conscious of curious</p>
<p>glances from several strangers who were standing about, and eustace exchanged a few words with a species of regal condescension</p>
<p>here and there as they went. and then they Were out in the pure sunlight of the mountains, alone for</p>
<p>the last time in their paradise of snow. almost instinctively dinah turned up the winding track. they had half an</p>
<p>hour before them, and she felt she could not bear to stand still. he strolled beside her, idly smoking, not</p>
<p>troubling to make conversation, now as ever sublimely at his ease. the snow sparkled around them like a thousand gems</p>
<p>dinah s eyes were burning and smarting with the brightness, and still that tender waltz-music ran lilting through her brain,</p>
<p>drifting as it were through the mist of her unshed tears. suddenly he spoke. they were nearing the pine-wood and</p>
<p>quite alone. "is there anything the matter?" she choked down a great lump in her throat before she could speak</p>
<p>in answer. "no," she murmured then. "i--i am just--rather low about leaving; that s all." "quite all?" he said. his</p>
<p>tone was so casual, so normal, that it seemed impossible now to think of last night s happening save as</p>
<p>an extravagant dream. she almost felt for the moment as if she had imagined it all. and then he spoke</p>
<p>again, and she Caught a subtle note of tenderness in his voice that brought it all back upon her in</p>
<p>an overwhelming rush. "that s really all, is it? you re not unhappy about anything else? scott hasn t been</p>
<p>bullying you?" she gasped at the question. "oh no! oh no! he wouldn t! he couldn t! i--haven t even</p>
<p>seen him today." he received the information in silence; but in a moment or two he tossed away his cigarette</p>
<p>with the air of a man having come to an abrupt resolution. "and so you re fretting about going home?"</p>
<p>he said. she nodded mutely. the matter would not bear discussion. "poor little daphne." he said. "it s been a</p>
<p>good game, hasn t it?" she nodded again. "just like the dreams that never come true," she managed to say.</p>
<p>"would you like it to come true?" he asked her unexpectedly. she glanced up at him with a woeful little</p>
<p>smile. "it s no good thinking of that, is it?" she said. "i have an idea we could make it</p>
<p>come true between us," he said. she shook her head. that brief glimpse of his intent eyes had sent a</p>
<p>sudden and overwhelming wave of shyness through her. she remembered again the fiery holding of his arms, and was afraid.</p>
<p>he paused in his walk and turned aside to the railing that bounded the side of the track above the</p>
<p>steep, pine-covered descent. "wish hard enough," he said, "and all dreams come true!" dinah went with him as if compelled,</p>
<p>she leaned against the railing, glad of the support, while he sat down upon it. his attitude was supremely easy</p>
<p>and self-possessed. "do you know, Japhne," he said, "i ve taken a fancy to that particular dream myself? now i</p>
<p>ve caught you, i don t see myself letting you go again." her heart throbbed at his words. she bent</p>
<p>her head, fixing her eyes upon the rough wood upon which she leaned. "but it s no good, is it?"</p>
<p>she said, almost below her breath. "i ve just got to go." he put his hand on her shoulder, and</p>
<p>she was conscious afresh of the electricity of his touch. she shrank a little--a very little; for she was frightened,</p>
<p>albeit Curiously aware of a magnetism that drew her irresistibly. "yes, i suppose you ve got to go," he said.</p>
<p>"but--there s nothing to prevent me following you, is there?" she quivered from head to foot, that hand upon her</p>
<p>shoulder sent such a tumult of emotions through her that she could not collect her thoughts in any coherent order.</p>
<p>"i--i don t know," she whispered, bending her head still lower. "they--i don t know what they would say at</p>
<p>home." "your people?" his hand was drawing her now with an insistent pressure that would not be denied. "they d</p>
<p>probably dance on their heads with delight," he said, his tone one of slightly supercilious humour. "i assure you i</p>
<p>am considered something of a catch by a good many anxious mammas." she started at that, started and straightened herself,</p>
<p>lifting shy eyes to his. "oh, but we ve only been--playing," she said rather uncertainly. "just--just pretending to flirt, that</p>
<p>s all." he laughed, bending his handsome, imperious face to hers. "it s been a fairly solid pretence, hasn t</p>
<p>it?" he said. "but i m proposing something slightly different now. i an offering you my hand--as well as my</p>
<p>heart." dinah was trembling all over. she gasped for breath, drawing back slightly from the nearness of his lips. "do</p>
<p>you mean--you d like--to marry me?" she whispered tremulously, and hid her face on the instant; for the bald words</p>
<p>sounded preposterous. he laughed again, softly, half-mockingly, and drew her into his arms. "whatever made you think of that, my</p>
<p>elf of the mountains? i ll vow it came into your head first. ah, you needn t hide your eyes</p>
<p>from me. i know you re mine--all mine. i ve known it from the first--ever since you began to run</p>
<p>away. but i ve caught you now. haven t i? haven t i?" she clung to him desperately. it</p>
