<p>some eastern home of the genii. i could not have believed that there existed upon this earth such adaptation of means to an end, such complete mastery of</p>
<p>every detail which may aid in stripping life of any of its petty worries." "i have something yet to show you," remarked raffles haw; "but we will rest</p>
<p>here for a few minutes, for i wished to have a word with you. how is the cigar?" "most excellent." "it was rolled in louisiana in the old</p>
<p>slavery days. there is nothing made like them now. the man who had them did not know their value. he let them go at merely a few shillings</p>
<p>apiece. now i want you to do me a favour, mr. mcintyre," "i shall be so glad," "you can see more or less how i am situated, i</p>
<p>am a complete stranger here. with the well-to-do classes i have little in common. i am no society man. i don t want to call or be called</p>
<p>on. i am a student in a small Way, and a man of quiet tastes. i have no social ambitions at all. do you understand?" "entirely," "on the</p>
<p>other hand, my experience of the world has been that it is the rarest thing to be able to form a friendship with a poorer man--i mean with</p>
<p>a man who is at all eager to increase his income. they think much of your wealth, and little of yourself, i have tried, you understand, and i</p>
<p>know." he paused and ran his fingers through his thin beard. robert mcintyre nodded to show that he appreciated his position. "now, you see," he continued, "if i</p>
<p>am to be cut off from the rich by my own tastes, and from those who are not rich by my distrust of their motives, my situation is</p>
<p>an isolated one. not that i mind isolation: i am used to it. but it limits my field of usefulness. i have no trustworthy means of informing myself</p>
<p>when and where i may do good. i have already, i am glad to say, met a man to-day, your vicar, who appears to be thoroughly unselfish and</p>
<p>trustworthy. he shall be one of my channels of communication with the outer world. might i ask you whether you would be willing to become another?" "with the</p>
<p>greatest pleasure," said robert eagerly. the proposition filled his heart with joy, for it seemed to give him an almost official connection with this paradise of a house.</p>
<p>he Could not have asked for anything more to his taste, "i was fortunate enough to discover by your conversation how high a ground you take in such</p>
<p>matters, and how entirely disinterested you are. you may have observed that i was short and almost rude with you at first. i have had reason to fear</p>
<p>and Suspect all Chance friendships. too often they have proved to be carefully planned beforehand, with some sordid obiect in view. good heavens, what stories i could tell</p>
<p>you." a lady pursued by a bull--i have risked my life to save her, and have learned afterwards that the scene had been arranged by the mother as</p>
<p>an effective introduction, and that the bull had been hired by the hour. but i won t shake your faith in human nature, i have had some rude</p>
<p>shocks myself. i look, perhaps, with a iaundiced eye on all who come near me. it is the more needful that i should have one whom i can</p>
<p>trust to advise me." "if you will only show me where my opinion can be of any use i shall be most happy," said robert. "my people come</p>
<p>from birmingham, but i know most of the folk here and their position." "that is just what i want. money can do so much good, and it may</p>
<p>do so much harm. i shall consult you when i am in doubt. by the way, there is one small question which i might ask you now. can</p>
<p>you tell me who a young lady is with very dark hair, grey eyes, and a finely chiselled face? she wore a blue dress when i saw her,</p>
<p>with astrachan about her neck and cuffs." robert chuckled to himself. "i know that dress pretty well," he said. "it is my sister laura whom you describe." "your</p>
<p>sister! really! why, there is a resemblance, now that my attention is called to it. i saw her the other day, and wondered who she might be. she</p>
<p>lives with you, of Course?" "yes." my father, she, and i live together at elmdene." "where i hope to have the pleasure of making their acquaintance. you have</p>
<p>finished your cigar." have another, or try a pipe. to the real smoker all is mere trifling save the pipe. i have most brands of tobacco here. the</p>
<p>lockers are filled on the monday, and on saturday they are handed over to the old folk at the alms-houses, so i manage to keep it pretty fresh</p>
<p>always. well, if you won t take anything else, perhaps you would care to see one or two of the other effects which i have devised. on</p>
