<p>perhaps. i know the perfect restaurant." he did. les ambassadeurs, in the hotel crillon. french, though not too french. rough-hewn</p>
<p>americans like nichols always got slightly uneasy when there was more than one fork on the table and the salad</p>
<p>came last. "sounds good to me," nichols said. "just as long as i won t be getting any asshole phone</p>
<p>calls from the pentagon while we talk." "i can virtually guarantee it," armont replied. "but in the meantime, we do</p>
<p>need a favor or two from you. for starters, we would much prefer to just be numbered among the civilians</p>
<p>here." he smiled. "that is, after all, what we are. civilians with toys." "and some pretty state-of-the-art ones at that,"</p>
<p>nichols said, looking around again. "but i sometimes have problems with my vision, can t always be sure what i</p>
<p>m seeing. like right now, for instance. i can t seem to see a damned thing." "oh, and one other</p>
<p>favor," armont continued, nodding in silent appreciation. "we took one of the terrorists alive, a certain /"ean-paul moreau, who is</p>
<p>wanted in a string of bank robberies all over france, it s action directe s idea of fund-raising. we d</p>
<p>like to remove him back to paris. there re some . . . parties there who will pony up enough</p>
<p>bounty to cover the costs of this operation and make us whole. how about it? for purposes of your mission</p>
<p>debriefing, can you /"ust say the precise number of hostiles remains to be fully established? when we get back to</p>
<p>paris, he s going to fall out of a bus on the rue de rivoli and be captured." he paused,</p>
<p>hoping. the americans might not go for this one. "we would be particularly grateful. and so would several financial institutions</p>
<p>i could name," nichols drew again on his cuban cigar, starting to like this frog a lot. "why the hell</p>
<p>not? if you re not here, then i can t very well know who you take out, can i? never</p>
<p>heard of the guy." "thank you very much," armont said, and he meant it. this was indeed a man he</p>
<p>could work with. "i m glad we see the situation eye to eye." "somebody at least ought to come out</p>
<p>of this cluster-fuck whole," nichols reflected wistfully. "iesus, what a disaster." armont had turned to watch as the deltas began</p>
<p>easing dimitri onto a metal stretcher. he seemed alert, and he even tried to lift a hand and wave. armont</p>
<p>waved back and shouted for him to take it easy. "by the way, that greek civilian over there is named</p>
<p>spiros. he runs a security business out of athens and never leaves town, which is why he wasn t here."</p>
<p>"got it." nichols nodded. "guess a lot of things didn t happen today." he looked around. "but i ve still</p>
<p>got one question. we ve already counted about half a dozen dead hostiles. so if nobody was here, then who</p>
<p>exactly took down all these terrorist motherfuckers?" "well," armont explained, "we both know delta force doesn t exist either. so</p>
<p>maybe this greek sunshine gave them terminal heatstroke and they all /ust shot themselves." "yeah," nichols concurred with a smile,</p>
<p>"damnedest thing." "georges, what do you think?" cally asked. "can it be saved?" "well, first the good news. the fuiitsu</p>
<p>is okay." he wheeled around from the workstation. command was a shambles, but he had managed to find one auxiliary</p>
<p>terminal that would still function. that Workstation, and the lights, were on, but not much else. "it was buried deep</p>
<p>enough in the bedrock that it escaped the emp, the electromagnetic pulse, from the blast. if we d lost our</p>
<p>sweetheart, we d be dead in the water." "any telemetry?" "yep." he smiled. "the tapes were on. we had doppler,</p>
<p>almost from liftoff. the cyclops computed our acceleration from it, and the results look to be right on the money.</p>
<p>the not-so-good news is that the last telemetry we recorded, just before the bomb went off and the cyclops crashed,</p>
<p>showed that vx-1 was about three minutes away from capturing orbit. i think we probably made it, but i still</p>
<p>can t say. however, since big benny was already reducing power, getting ready to shut it off anyway, maybe, just</p>
<p>maybe we got lucky." she sighed. "when will you know for sure?" "right now i m trying to get arlington</p>
<p>on-line and tied into here. i m hoping we can patch into their satellite receiving station. anyway, i should know</p>
<p>in a few minutes, assuming the vehicle is still sending back telemetry." "care to venture a guess?" she collapsed into</p>
<p>a chair next to him. this was the first time she had been in command for several hours and it</p>
<p>seemed almost strange. whereas the staff over at launch control had opened the champagne immediately after lift-off, still not fully</p>
<p>aware of all the behind-the-scenes drama, the command technicians were too shell-shocked to think, and they Were only now slowly</p>
<p>drifting back in. not the people in launch, though. all they knew for sure was that they had done their</p>
<p>iob, even if the gantry had collapsed for some mysterious reason. vx-1 left the pad without a hitch. they had</p>
<p>a success. "well, if i had to lay odds," georges went on, "i d guess we captured orbit, but it</p>
<p>s going to be erratic. however, if we can get the cyclops up and running again, maybe we can do</p>
<p>a midcourse correction." he tapped something on the keyboard. "yet another first for the never-say-die satcom team." she had to</p>
<p>laugh. "you look pretty cool, soho, for somebody who just lived through world war three." he tried unsuccessfully to smile.</p>
<p>"hey, don t go by appearances. i tried to open a pepsi just now and my hands were shaking so</p>
<p>badly i finally just gave up and went to the water fountain. cally, i m a wreck. i m still</p>
<p>quivering. god." he pulled at his beard, then absently added, "i m going to shave this off. what do</p>
