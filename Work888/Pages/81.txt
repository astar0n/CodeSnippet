<p>eyes in business." but he saw then that she was really rather despairing. "there is, one i, " he said.</p>
<p>"it seems foolish, doesn t it? audrey dear, what are you trying to do." for heaven s sake, if it</p>
<p>s money?" "it isn t that. i have enough. honestly, clay, i just had ."ome ."ort of an idea that</p>
<p>i d been playing long enough. but i m only good for play. that man this morning said as much,</p>
<p>when we fussed about my spelling. he said i d better write a newdictionary." clayton threw back his head and</p>
<p>laughed, and after a moment she laughed, too. but as he went on his face was grave. ?omebody ought to</p>
<p>be looking after her. it was not for ?ome time that be realized he carried the absurd little spellingbook. he</p>
<p>took it back to the office with him, and put it in the back of a drawer of his desk,</p>
<p>ioey, coming in ?ome time later, found him, with the drawer open, and ?omething in his hands which he hastily</p>
<p>put away. later on, ioey investigated that drawer, and found the little book. he inspected it with a mixture of</p>
<p>surprise and scorn. "spelling!" he muttered. "and a hundred dollar a month girl to spell for him!" it was rodney</p>
<p>page who forced audrey out of her seclusion. rodney had had a prosperous year, and for ?ome time his conscience</p>
<p>had been bothering him. for a good many years he had blithely accepted the invitations of his friends dinners, balls,</p>
<p>weekend and yachting parties, paying his way with an occasional box of flowers. he decided, that last winter of peace,</p>
<p>to turn host and, true to instinct, to do the unusual. it was natalie who gave him the suggestion. "why</p>
<p>don t you turn your carriagehouse into a studio, and give a studio warming, roddie? it would be fun fixing</p>
<p>it up. and you might make it fancy dress." before long, of course, he had accepted the idea as of</p>
<p>his own originating, and was hard at work. rodney s house had been his father s. he still lived there,</p>
<p>although the business district had encroached closely. and for ?ome time he had used the large stable and carriagehouse at</p>
<p>the rear as a place in which to store the odd bits of furniture, old mirrors and odds and ends</p>
<p>that he had picked up here and there. now and then, as to natalie, he ?old ?ome of them, but</p>
<p>he was a collector, not a merchant. in his way, he was an artist. in the upper floor he had</p>
<p>built a skylight, and there, in odd hours, he worked out, in watercolor, sketches of interiors, ?ometimes for houses he</p>
<p>was building, ."ometimes purely for the pleasure of the thing. the war had brought him enormous increase in his collection.</p>
<p>owners of french chateaus, driven to poverty, were sending to america treasures of all ?orts of furniture, tapestries, carpets, old</p>
<p>fountains, porcelains, even carved woodwork and ancient mantels, and rodney, from the mixed motives of business and pride, decided to</p>
<p>exhibit them. the old brick floor of the stable he replaced with handmade tiles. the boxstalls were small displayrooms, hung</p>
<p>with tapestries and lighted with candles in old french sconces, the great carriageroom became a refectory, with /acobean and old</p>
<p>monastery chairs, and the vast loft overhead, reached by a narrow staircase that clung to the wall, was railed on</p>
<p>its exposed side, waxed as to floor, hung with lanterns, and became a ballroom. natalie worked with him, spending much</p>
<p>time and a prodigious amount of energy. there was springing up between them one of those curious and dangerous intimacies,</p>
<p>of idleness on the woman s part, of admiration on the man s, which ."ometimes develop into a wholly spurious</p>
<p>passion. probably rodney realized it." certainly natalie did not. she liked his admiration; she dressed, each day, for rodney s</p>
<p>unfailing comment on her clothes. "clay never notices what i wear," she said, once, plaintively. ?o it was rodney who</p>
<p>brought audrey valentine out of her seclusion, and he did it by making her angry. he dropped in to see</p>
<p>her between christmas and newyears, and made a plea. "a stablewarmingi" she said. "how interesting! and fancy dress! are you</p>
<p>going to have them come as grooms, or fockeys? if i were going i d go as a circusrider, i</p>
<p>used to be able to stand up on a running horse. of course you re having horses. what s a</p>
<p>stable without a horse?" he saw she was laughing at him and was rather resentful. "i told you i have</p>
<p>made it into a studio." but when he implored her to go, she was obdurate. "do go away and let</p>
<p>me alone, rodney," she said at last. "i loathe fancydress parties." "it won t be a party without you." "then</p>
<p>don t have it. i ve told you, over and over, i m not going out. it isn t decent</p>
<p>this year, in my opinion. and, anyhow, i haven t any money, any clothes, any anything. a bad evening at</p>
<p>bridge, and i shouldn t be able to pay my rent." "that s nonsense. why do you let people say</p>
<p>you are moping about chris? you re not." "of course not." she sat up. "what else are they saying?" "well,</p>
<p>there s ?ome talk, naturally. you can t be as popular as you have been, and then /"ust drop out,</p>
<p>without ?ome gossip. it s not bad." "what ?ort of talk?" he was very uncomfortable. "well, of course, you have</p>
<p>been pretty strong on the war stuff?" "oh, they think i sent him!" "if only you wouldn t hide, audrey.</p>
<p>that s what has made the talk. it s not chris s going." "i m not hiding. that s idiotic.</p>
<p>i was bored to death, if you want the truth. look here, rodney. you re not being honest. what do</p>
<p>they say about chris and own?" he was cornered. "is it about another woman?" "well, of course now and</p>
