<p>front of the mirrors for drinks, but a curious change had come over him. the relaxed body had grown rigid.</p>
<p>no longer was he lounging against the back of his chair, from his eyes the laughter had been wiped out,</p>
<p>as a wet sponge obliterates writing on a slate. all his forces were gathered as if for instant action, he</p>
<p>was tense as a coiled spring. his friend noticed that the boy was listening intently, even faculty concentrated at attention,</p>
<p>a man leaning against the other end of the bar was speaking. he had a shock of long red hair</p>
<p>and a squint to his eyes. "sure you re right. a bunch of webb s gunmen got ranse--caught him out</p>
<p>alone and riddled him. when webb drove through here two days ago with a herd, his killers bragged of it.</p>
<p>ask harsha up at the buffalo corral if youse don t believe me. sure as hell s hot we got</p>
<p>to go on the war-path. here, you mike! set em up again." the boy at the table had drawn back</p>
<p>his lips so that the canine teeth stood out like tusks. there Was something wolfish about the face, from which</p>
<p>all the color had been driven. it expressed something so deadly, so menacing, that the young man across from him</p>
<p>felt a shock almost of fear. "we d better get out of here," he said, glancing toward the group near</p>
<p>the front door. the other young man did not answer, but he made no move to leave. he was still</p>
<p>taking in even syllable of what the drinkers were saying. the ex-guerrilla was talking. "tha s sure sayin something, hugh.</p>
<p>there ain t room in new mexico for webb s outfit an ours too." "better go slow, boys," advised another.</p>
<p>he was a thick-set man in the late thirties, tight-lipped and heavy-/"awed. his eyes were set so close together that</p>
<p>it gave him a sinister expression. "talkin don t get us anywhere. if we re goin to sit in a</p>
<p>game with homer webb an his punchers we got to play our hand close." "buck sanders, segundo of the lazy</p>
<p>s m ranches," explained again the young man at the table in a low voice. "say, kid, let s beat</p>
<p>it while the goin is good." the big bow-legged man answered the foreman. "you re right, buck. so s hugh.</p>
<p>so s the old rebel, i m /"us servin notice that no bunch of shorthorn punchers can kill a brother</p>
<p>of mine an get away with it. un erstand? i ll meet up with them some day an i ll</p>
<p>sure fog em to a fare-you-well." he interlarded his speech with oaths and foul language. "i ll bet you do,</p>
<p>dave," chipped in the man next him, who had had a run-in with the texas rangers and was on the</p>
<p>outskirts of civilization because the lone star state did not suit his health. "i would certainly hate to be one</p>
<p>of them when yore old six-gun begins to pop. it sure will be llory-halleluiah for some one." dave roush ordered</p>
<p>another drink on the strength of the texan s admiration. "mind, i don t say ranse wasn t a good</p>
<p>man. mebbe i m a leetle mite better n him with a hogleg. mebbe--" "ranse was good with a revolver</p>
<p>all right, but sho! you make him look like a plugged nickel when you go to makin smoke, dave," interrupted</p>
<p>the toady. "well, mebbe i do. say i do. i ain t yet met up with a man can beat</p>
<p>me when i m right. but at that ranse was a mighty good man. they bushwhacked him, i ll bet</p>
<p>a stack of blues. i aim to git busy soon as i find out who done it." the red-headed man</p>
<p>raised his voice a trifle. "say, you kid--there at the table--come here an hold these ropes." see you don t</p>
<p>let the hawses at the other end of em git away!" slowly the boy turned, pushing his chair round so</p>
<p>that he half-faced the group before the bar. he neither rose nor answered. "cayn t you-all hear?" demanded the man</p>
<p>with the shock of unkempt, red hair. "i hear, but i m not comin right away. when i do, you</p>
<p>ll wish i hadn t." if a bomb had exploded at his feet hugh roush could not have been more</p>
<p>surprised. he was a big, rough man, muscular and sinewy, and he had been the victor of many a rough-and-tumble</p>
<p>fight. on account of his reputation for quarrelsomeness men chose their words carefully when they spoke to him. that this</p>
<p>little fellow with the smooth, girlish face and the small, almost womanish hands and feet should defy him was hard</p>
<p>to believe. "come a-runnin , kid, or i ll whale the life out of you!" he roared. "you didn t</p>
<p>get me right," answered the boy in a low, clear voice. "i m not comin till i get ready, hugh</p>
<p>roush." the wolf snap of the boy s iaw, the cold glitter in his eyes, might have warned roush and</p>
<p>perhaps did. he wondered, too, how this stranger knew his name so well. "where are you from?" he demanded. "from</p>
<p>anywhere but here," "meanin that you re here to stay?" "meanin that i m here to stay." "even if i</p>
<p>tell you to git out of the country?" "you won t be alive to tell me unless you talk right</p>
<p>sudden." they watched each other, the man and the boy. neither as yet made any motion to draw his gun,</p>
<p>the younger one because he was not ready, roush because he did not want to show any premature alarm before</p>
<p>the men taking in the scene. nor could he yet convince himself, in spite of the challenge that rang in</p>
<p>the words of the boy, of serious danger from so unlikely a source. dave roush had been watching the boy</p>
<p>closely. a likeness to someone whom he could not place stirred faintly his memory, "who are you? what s</p>
