<p>gave way to the rocks at the base of the point. iohn mewes puffed along close at his heels, and</p>
<p>after him came the first mate, dick hawkins, unshaven but alert, musket at the ready. close behind strode tall edwin</p>
<p>spune, master s mate, a musket in each hand, followed by the rest. in all, some twenty of winston s</p>
<p>men had crossed the bay with him. he ordered the longboats beached, then called the men together and motioned for</p>
<p>quiet. "are all muskets primed?" "aye." spurre stepped forward, holding his two muskets up as though for inspection. "an every</p>
<p>man s got an extra bandolier of powder an shot. we re ready for whatever the whoresons try." he glanced</p>
<p>up the rise, puzzled, still not understanding why the captain had assembled them. but hugh winston liked having his orders</p>
<p>obeyed. "good." winston walked down the line. "spread out along the shore and wait. i m going up to see</p>
<p>what the shooting s about. just stand ready till you hear from me. but if you see me fire a</p>
<p>pistol shot, you be up that hill like iack-be-nimble. is that clear?" "you mean us against all that bleedin lot</p>
<p>up there?" iohn mewes squinted toward the dark rise. "there s apt to be half their militia up there, cap</p>
<p>n, from the sound of it." "did i hear you question an order, iohn." you know ship s rules. they</p>
<p>go for officers too." he turned to the other men. "should we call a vote right here?" "god s life."</p>
<p>mewes pushed forward, remembering winston s formula for discipline on the defiance. he didn t even own a cat-o nine-tails,</p>
<p>the lash used by most ship captains for punishment. he never touched an offender. he always just put trial and</p>
<p>punishment to a show of hands by the men-whose favorite entertainment was keelhauling any seaman who disobeyed captain s orders,</p>
<p>lashing a line to his waist and ducking him under the hull till he was half drowned. "i wasn t</p>
<p>doin no questioning. not for a minute. i must ve just been mumbling in my sleep." "then try and stay</p>
<p>awake. i in going up there now, alone. but if i need you, you d better be there, iohn. with</p>
<p>the men. that s an order." "aye." mewes performed what passed for a salute, then cocked his musket with a</p>
<p>flourish. winston loosened the pistols in his belt, checked the packet containing the sight bills and the other papers he</p>
<p>had brought, then headed directly up the rise. the approach to lookout point was deserted, but up the hill, behind</p>
<p>a new stack of logs, he could see the shadowy outline of a crowd. the barricade, no more than fifty</p>
<p>yards from the assembly room, was in the final stages of construction, as men with torches dragged logs forward. others,</p>
<p>militia officers, were stationed behind the logs with muskets and were returning pistol fire from the half-open doorway of the</p>
<p>assembly room. above the din he could hear the occasional shouts of beniamin briggs, who appeared to be in charge.</p>
<p>together with him were the members of the council and officers from their regiments. the command of the militia was</p>
<p>restricted to major landholders: a field officer had to own at least a hundred acres, a captain fifty, a lieutenant</p>
<p>twenty-five, and even an ensign had to have fifteen. on the barricade were straw-hatted indentures belonging to members of the</p>
<p>council, armed only with pikes since the Planters did not trust them with muskets. winston recognized among them many whom</p>
<p>he had agreed to take. the firing was sputtering to a lull as he approached. then briggs spotted him and</p>
<p>yelled out. "you d best be gone, sir. before someone in the assembly room gets a mind to put a</p>
<p>round of pistol shot in your breeches." "i m not part of your little war." "that you re decidedly not,</p>
<p>sir. so we ll not be requiring your services here tonight." "what s the difficulty?" winston was still walking directly</p>
<p>toward them. "it s a matter of the safety of barbados. i ve said it doesn t concern you." "those</p>
<p>indentures concern me. i don t want them shot." "tell that to the assembly, sir. we came here tonight offering</p>
<p>to take dalby bedford under our care, peacefully. to protect him from elements on the island who re set to</p>
<p>disown parliament. but some of the hotheads in there mistook our peaceful purpose and opened fire on us." "maybe they</p>
<p>think they can protect him better than you can." another round of fire sounded from the doorway of the assembly</p>
<p>room and thudded into the log barricade. when two of the planters cursed and fired back, the door was abruptly</p>
<p>slammed shut. "it s the assembly that s usurped rightful rule here, sir, as tonight should amply show. when they</p>
<p>no longer represent the true interests of barbados." briggs glared at him. "we re re-storing proper authority to this island,</p>
<p>long overdue." "you and the council can restore whatever you like. i m /"ust here to take care of my</p>
<p>indentures, before you manage to have some of them killed." "they re not yours yet, sir. the situation s changed.</p>
<p>we re not letting them go whilst the island s unsettled." "the only unsettling thing i see here are all</p>
<p>those muskets." he reached into the pocket of his ierkin and lifted out the leather packet containing the sight drafts.</p>
<p>"so we re going to make that transfer, right now. "well, i m damned if you ll have a single</p>
<p>man, this is not the time agreed." briggs looked around at the other members of the council. behind them the</p>
<p>crowd of indentures had stopped work to listen. "the sight bills are payable on demand. we ve settled the terms,</p>
<p>and i m officially calling them in." winston passed over the packet. "you ve got plenty of witnesses. here re</p>
<p>the sight bills. as of now, the indentures are mine." he pulled a sheaf of papers from the other</p>
