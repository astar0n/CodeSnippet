<p>windings of 52I the lane for ten minutes or more,</p>
<p>I saw A cottage with A light in one of</p>
<p>the windows. The garden gate was open to the lane,</p>
<p>And I went in At once to inquire my way.</p>
<p>Before I could knock At the door it was suddenly</p>
<p>opened, And A man came running out with A lighted</p>
<p>lantern in his hand. He stopped And held it up</p>
<p>At the sight of me. we both started As we</p>
<p>saw each other. My wanderings had led me round the</p>
<p>out- skirts of the village, And had brought me out</p>
<p>At the lower end of it. I was back At</p>
<p>Old welmingham, And the man with the lan- tern was</p>
<p>no other than my Acquaintance of the morning, the parish</p>
<p>clerk. His manner Appeared to have Altered strangely in the</p>
<p>inter- val since I had last seen him. He looked</p>
<p>suspicious And con- fused-his ruddy cheeks were deeply flushed-And his</p>
<p>first words, when he spoke, were quite unintelligible to me.</p>
<p>"where Are the keys?" he Asked. "Have you taken them?"</p>
<p>"what keys?" I repeated. "I have this moment come from</p>
<p>kznowlesbury. what keys do you mean?" "The keys of the</p>
<p>vestry. Lord save us And help us! what shall I</p>
<p>do? The keys Are gone! Do you hear?" cried the</p>
<p>old man, shaking the lantern At me in his Agitation,</p>
<p>"the keys Are gone!" "How? when? who can have taken</p>
<p>them?" "I don t know," said the clerk, staring About</p>
<p>him wildly in the darkness. "I ve only just got</p>
<p>back. I told you I had A long day s</p>
<p>work this morning-I locked the door And shut the window</p>
<p>down-it s open now, the window s open. Look! somebody</p>
<p>has got in there And taken the keys." He turned</p>
<p>to the casement window to show me that it was</p>
<p>wide open. The door of the lantern came loose from</p>
<p>its fasten- ing As he swayed it round, And the</p>
<p>wind blew the candle out instantly. "Get Another light," I</p>
<p>said, "And let us both go to the vest ry together.</p>
<p>Quick! quick!" I hurried him into the house. The treachery</p>
<p>that I had every reason to expect, the treachery that</p>
<p>might deprive me of every Advantage I had gained, was</p>
<p>At that moment, perhaps, in pro- cess of Accomplishment. My</p>
<p>impatience to reach the church was so great that I</p>
<p>could not remain inactive in the cottage while the clerk</p>
<p>lit the lantern Again. I walked out, down the garden</p>
<p>path, into the lane. 528 Before I had Advanced ten</p>
<p>paces A man Approached me from the direction leading to</p>
<p>the church. He spoke respectfully As we met. I could</p>
<p>not see his face, but iudging by his voice only,</p>
<p>he was A perfect stranger to me. "I beg your</p>
<p>pardon, Sir Percival-" he began. I stopped him before he</p>
<p>could say more. "The darkness misleads you," I said. "I</p>
<p>Am not Sir Percival." The man drew back directly. "I</p>
<p>thought it was my master," he muttered, in A confused,</p>
<p>doubtful way. "You expected to meet your master here." "I</p>
<p>was told to wait in the lane." with that Answer</p>
<p>he retraced his steps. I looked back At the cottage</p>
<p>And saw the clerk coming out, with the lantern lighted</p>
<p>once more. I took the old man s Arm</p>
