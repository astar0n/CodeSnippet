<p>for; very impressive the way you kept paul from leaving today." rewsna had switched subjects so quickly, i had hardly</p>
<p>noticed. i couldn t help but ask what i d been feeling since it happened, "you knew i was going</p>
<p>to meet him, didn t you? that is why you wouldn t let me follow you off the bus earlier?"</p>
<p>she didn t answer, but for the first time since i had met her, i was able to read her</p>
<p>the way i could everyone else, and that was exactly why she made me stay, "on my path," to the</p>
<p>mall. "your love," again she had the tiles l-o-v-e "for the others around you will," she moved the tiles and</p>
<p>added an additional e-v "evolve to meet your destiny." e-v-o-l-v-e was staring at me from the tabletop. none of what</p>
<p>she was saying made much sense. i looked back at the tabletop to see her playing with five new tiles.</p>
<p>before she could give me any new message, her lips didn t move but her voice was clear in my</p>
<p>head, "lauren, you know what you must do. i know you will figure out how. i wish you luck, but</p>
<p>i don t believe you will need it. you do not have to seek me Out," i already told you,</p>
<p>i will be watching you." "rewsna, i feel so strange, as if you are the only person i can ask</p>
<p>questions. if i share any of this with anyone else i know, they ll think i m nuts." "precious lauren,</p>
<p>you are more sensitive than any soul i ve met. you see things clearly that others wouldn t notice if</p>
<p>it reached up and slapped them in the face. you don t need me. the answers to your questions are</p>
<p>inside you and with your soul mate. make him understand the question, and he will give you the answers you</p>
<p>seek." i knew that our meeting was over, so i thanked her, out loud, of course, and stepped out of</p>
<p>the cafe. i hadn t really learned anything new, but my feelings were confirmed. it s as if everything is</p>
<p>predetermined, but free will results in different outcomes. i looked at my watch and realized it was already two o</p>
<p>clock. i was supposed to meet max at three, so i made my way to the bus stop across from</p>
<p>the library. under a fattened nose and his shoulders were as broad as a bull s. all son of farc</p>
<p>wore were faded blue pants, tattered at the bottom, with a belt made out of hair. farc had worn a</p>
<p>similar belt, a variety of hair pulled from the heads of the ogres vanquished opponents. venir tied his long locks</p>
<p>back. he had no desire to become a part of the ogre s strange trophy. son of farc reached up,</p>
<p>grabbing the upper rim of the Cage and bounded to the top. the ogre then shoved the two armored orcs</p>
<p>off of the top, opened the drop-down gate and iumped inside. looking down at venir, the son of farc displayed</p>
<p>a smile full of rotting yellow teeth above his iutting /"aw. above, the orcs slammed the gate down and prepared</p>
<p>to lower the weapon. but as a morning star was about to be lowered, farc, from the audience, made them</p>
<p>stop, signaling no weapon with his ?sts in the air. the crowd booed and hissed, but then farc s roar</p>
<p>settled them down. this ?ght was to be bare knuckles, teeth, knees, elbows, you-got-it you-use-it; /"ust the way it was</p>
<p>the last time. it was all venir now. no help, no brool, no choice. he cast a glance at his</p>
<p>friends, they all looked worried. better off dying doing something. he was dripping like a waterfall as he removed his</p>
<p>sweat soaked ierkin. he tried to shake the flow of blood into his fingers. he felt numb, lethargic and unprepared,</p>
<p>but a twinge of anger was burning somewhere. he could hear voices in the crowed shouting about the big v-shaped</p>
<p>tattoo on his over muscled back. vermin, vulgar, vile, villain, the mixed races had screamed, victorious said another, much to</p>
<p>the laughter of the others. a few coins exchanged in favor of the more formidable looking man that had beaten</p>
<p>farc before. the son of farc snorted, staring at his sneering father who stood on the balcony above. venir wasn</p>
<p>t the less experienced man farc had fought years earlier, rather different, weathered and frightening, venir looked over again at</p>
<p>his comrades, all pressed near the cage. mikkel gave him a puzzled look, while melegal gave him meager thumbs up.</p>
<p>the crowd s voices became a manageable rumble as a grey-bearded dwarf sauntered over to a bronze gong as tall</p>
<p>as an ogre. the ancient dwarf stared up at the royals in the bleachers, hoisting the mallet high above his</p>
<p>head. a tall orcen man, leaner than the rest, stood and raised his palms outward in the air. the crowd</p>
<p>hushed. a handful of coins clinked onto the bleachers and rattled down. venir s eyes locked of son of farc</p>
<p>s. there was ice in the ogre s stare, and fire behind the ice. venir could feel the rush of</p>
<p>blood flowing behind his ears. die doing something! the tall orc s palms knotted into big fists. two long hairy</p>
<p>thumbs ?icked upwards. bong! venir sprang like a panther and punched son of farc straight in the nose. the ogre</p>
<p>3 head rocked back with a notable crack, and first blood had been drawn. the roar of the crowd was</p>
<p>a dull hum in venir s pulsating ears. son of farc was holding his broken nose, furious, swatting his long</p>
<p>arms back and forth, and forcing venir to dodge away. venir watched as the ogre grinned, smearing the dripping blood</p>
<p>with his forearm along his chin. now, ogre beckoned to the man with his ?nger. the crowd went wild. venir</p>
<p>s hand ached and he realized it was going to be a hard and dirty ?ght. the two circled</p>
