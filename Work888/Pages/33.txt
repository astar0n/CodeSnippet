<p>a theory of the society to be transformed: ideological weapons for the causes and a strategy based upon immanent potentials</p>
<p>of both the process of change and the establishment of a better world. to accomplish these tasks coherently and powerfully,</p>
<p>the ideology critique cannot be arbitrary. critical thought must burrow into the core of the social world, contemporary practice, the</p>
<p>production of daily social existence, the creation of commodities and the reinforcement of the commodity mode of production. the unity</p>
<p>of theory and practice in marx s work is not the subiugation of thought to political activism. practice involves above</p>
<p>all the production of material goods, but also the reproduction of social relations (including the relations of production), attitudes, legal</p>
<p>order, military defense, etc. capital, a theoretical work, stands in a unity with the practice of nineteenth century european society</p>
<p>in a number or ways: by focusing on the realm of production, marx was able to concretize each of these</p>
<p>points of unity in terms of the proletariat, thereby arriving at a concrete theory of the potential for transforming the</p>
<p>world in terms of a revolutionary subiect-ob/"ect of theoretically informed transformative practice. marx believed that every social theory is conditioned</p>
<p>by its social context, so that for every interpretation of the world there is a relation and interpenetration of theory</p>
<p>and practice. marx s own approach differs from others whether contractual, idealistic or scientistic in that his consciousness of this</p>
<p>relation led him to unify his theory and social practice by constructing his methodology primarily in terms of this relation.</p>
<p>recognizing that his manner of abstraction and his central categories had their conditions of possibility in the society whose structure</p>
<p>they were designed to articulate, marx could clearly define the socio-historical specificity of his concepts and he could perceive their</p>
<p>interrelationships in terms of the structure of bourgeois society. above all, marx s critical thrust was a conscious response to</p>
<p>the social mystification arising from the fetishism of commodities; it is as a conscious response to the ideological character of</p>
<p>capitalist society that marx transforms philosophy into ideology critique and the critique of political economy. the following sessions explore the</p>
<p>result of this transformation of philosophical interpretation of the world into transformative interpretation, the critical hermeneutic of the first two</p>
<p>dozen pages of the grundrisse, the notes and rough drafts of marx s economic studies, which were later published within</p>
<p>a more restricted scope in capital, provide an extended treatment of marx s method. valuable discussions of the following three</p>
<p>issues can be found in this "introduction," which guided marx s economic research: (1) the centrality of commodity production, {2}</p>
<p>the method of analyzing capitalist society, and {3} the relationship of transhistorically general to socio-historically specific concepts. the important session</p>
<p>of marx s grundrisse entitled "forms which precede capitalist production. (concerning the process which precedes the formation of the capitalist</p>
<p>relations of original accumulation)" elaborates upon several themes presented in the "introduction." the forty pages of this session contain the</p>
<p>only extended consideration of pre-capitalist societies in the thousand pages of analysis, yet here marx actually becomes repetitive. in the</p>
<p>formulations of his reconstructive approach to history and in his historical characterization of the notion of property, so important are</p>
<p>they to his concerns. marx s reconstruction of the history of property relations, understood in their relation to the prevailing</p>
<p>mode or production provides a unity to marx s doctrines, presents the core of his historical materialism, and supplies the</p>
<p>critical fulcrum for his critique of political economy. materialistic conceptualizations for the self-interpretation of the world marx s statement of</p>
<p>the priority of the category of production within an economic analysis of bourgeois society is so straightforward that it requires</p>
<p>little comment. he begins his analysis of the general relations of production to distribution, exchange, and consumption by giving the</p>
<p>traditional definitions of these terms as used by bourgeois economists (smith, ricardo, mill, etc.): the obvious notion: in production the</p>
<p>members of society appropriate (create, shape} the products of nature in accord with human needs; distribution determines the proportion in</p>
<p>which the individual shares in the product; exchange delivers the particular products into which the individual desires to convert the</p>
<p>portion. which distribution has assigned to him," and finally, in consumption, the products become objects of gratification, of individual appropriation.</p>
<p>. . thus production appears as the point of departure, consumption as the conclusion, distribution and exchange as the</p>
<p>middle, which is, however, itself twofold, since distribution is determined by society and exchange by individuals, [4I] the four basic</p>
<p>spheres of the capitalist economy are posited by bourgeois political economy as autonomous domains to be found in every economic</p>
<p>system. marx s analysis is dialectical, negating the theoretical limitations involved in viewing these domains as autonomous by explicating their</p>
<p>conceptual, structural and historical interdependence, finally arriving at production as in each case the historically determinant and determining essence behind</p>
<p>the multiple appearances. appealing to the traditional definitions just stated {e.g., consumption as appropriation of the object by the individual).</p>
<p>marx develops the relation of each domain to production in a strikingly hegelian style. concerning production and consumption, he thus</p>
<p>argues: production is also immediately consumption. twofold consumption subjective and objective: the individual not only develops his abilities in production,</p>
<p>but also expands them, uses them up in the act of production, just as natural procreation is a consumption of</p>
<p>life forces. secondly: consumption of the means of production, which become worn out through use, and are partly :"e.g., in</p>
<p>combustion) dissolved into their elements again. likewise, consumption of the raw material, which loses its natural form and composition by</p>
<p>being used up. the act of production is therefore in all its moments an act of consumption. . . .</p>
<p>the artistic obiect like every other product creates a public which is sensitive to art and en/"oys beauty. production thus</p>
<p>not only creates an obiect for the subiect, but also a sub/"ect for the obiect. . . . the important</p>
<p>thing to recognize here is only that, whether production and consumption are viewed as the activity of one or</p>
