<p>m still me, i don t mind. and, surprisingly, she found that she did not mind. she did not in</p>
<p>the least resent his violation of her most secret thoughts now that it was an accomplished fact, though she knew</p>
<p>that she would have shrunk from the prospect had she fully understood his intentions the previous night, subsequently she wondered</p>
<p>more than once whether he had not seen the likelihood of resentment and taken means to prevent it. for the</p>
<p>present her delight at the annihilation of the language obstacle easily swept away other considerations. she demanded to know more</p>
<p>of the machines, of life on mars, of himself and his people. the questions poured out in a string, making</p>
<p>him smile. you are so eager, he said, as if in apology. so anxious to learn. we must have been</p>
<p>like that once long ago. long ago? i meant when our race was young. we are old now: our planet</p>
<p>is old: we are born old compared with the oldest of you. had you come just a few centuries later,</p>
<p>you might have found no men." our long history would have ended. you ask of life on mars. i scarcely</p>
<p>know how to answer you for life, to you, is a thing of promise, whereas for us but i shall</p>
<p>show you. this city you are in was called is called hanno. it is the biggest of the seven cities</p>
<p>which are still inhabited, yet there are no more than three thousand men and women in it now. fewer and</p>
<p>fewer children are born to us. perhaps that is well. each generation only prolongs our decay. we have had a</p>
<p>glorious past but a glorious past is bitterness for a child with a hopeless future. for you who think of</p>
<p>life as striving, it will be difficult to understand. but can you do nothing? /"oan asked. you must know so</p>
<p>much. can t you find out why less children are born, and cure it? we could, perhaps, but is it</p>
<p>worth it? would you wish to bear a child for a life of imprisonment able to live only in our</p>
<p>artificial conditions such as this? we have tried all we can. We have even created monsters; scarcely human creatures which</p>
<p>were able to live in the thin air. but it needs more than mere physical strength to survive on a</p>
<p>planet such as this where nothing useful as food can grow. our monsters were too unintelligent to survive we ourselves,</p>
<p>too, unadapted physically. life as you see it means very little to us now. quite soon we shall be gone</p>
<p>and there will be only the machines. the machines." ioan repeated. what are the machines? they are the puzzle which</p>
<p>brought me here. she told him of the machine which had somehow reached earth. i felt nervous of it, she</p>
<p>owned, and i felt nervous of your machines last night. i think that is the first reaction of all of</p>
<p>us to our own machines. some never get beyond it, others get used to it, but when we think of</p>
<p>machines we feel that in spite of all they have given us and all they do for us there is</p>
<p>something malignant about them. their very presence forces us down ways we do not want to go. we have felt</p>
<p>that since we first had them." there have been books, plays, pictures with the malevolence of the machine for their</p>
<p>theme. the idea persists of the eventual conquest of man by the machine. you don t seem to see them</p>
<p>like that. we don t. but i told you that our minds work differently in many ways, our first, simple</p>
<p>machines were designed to help us over difficulties, and they were successful. but so were ours, weren t they? well,</p>
<p>were they? i learned quite a lot of your history when i looked into your mind last night, and it</p>
<p>seemed to me that they Were not. machines have come early into your race history. they were not necessary. they</p>
<p>were thrust suddenly upon a race with no great problems, a race, moreover, so primitive that it was still is</p>
<p>still full of superstition. we did not invent the machine until it was necessary for our survival. you invented the</p>
<p>machine and caused it to be necessary for your survival. it saved us, but you thrust it upon a world</p>
<p>not yet ready it, and you have failed to adapt to it. but we have changed. we ve changed enormously.</p>
<p>our whole outlook is utterly different from that of our great grandfathers and even of our grandfathers. we recognize that</p>
<p>in the modern world one must move with the times. you have changed, perhaps, but very little and that under</p>
<p>continual protest. in you, and i take it that you are typical of your race, the sentimental resistance to change</p>
<p>is immense. he paused, looking at her with a slight frown. on mars, he continued, man has been the most</p>
<p>adaptable of all the animal creations. and on earth, she put in. i wonder? it seems to me that your</p>
<p>race may be in grave danger almost as if you may be losing the power to adapt. man s rise</p>
<p>and his survival depend on his adaptability. it Was because the old masters of the world Could not adapt that</p>
<p>they lost their mastery. new conditions defeated them. you have created new conditions, but you have scarcely disturbed your ways</p>
<p>of living to suit them. it is little wonder to me that you fear the machine. even while you use</p>
<p>it you try to live the lives of craftsmen. you resent the change because you know subconsciously, and will not</p>
<p>admit openly, that it means an utter break with the past. a new force has come into your world which</p>
<p>makes an end inevitable. which is it to be an dof your system of life." or of your system and</p>
<p>yourselves together? ioan looked puzzled. but do you mean that all tradition is to be thrown aside? why, you</p>
