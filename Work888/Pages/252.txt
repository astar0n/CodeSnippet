<p>to bring from a distant part of the shop a pair of wheels, one of which was of iron and</p>
<p>weighed over four hundred pounds, while its mate was made of wood and finished off to look exactly like its</p>
<p>companion. the workman in the secret always looked out and got hold of the wooden wheel, which he could carry</p>
<p>off with ease, while his duped associate would struggle over the other to the unbounded amusement of the lookers-on. it</p>
<p>heightened the effect by selecting a small, weak man to help in the deception, and henshaw, liking this joke no</p>
<p>less than his men, on the third day of /"ack s apprenticeship, said: "north, you and mires bring along them</p>
<p>wheels at the lower end. don t be all day about it either," speaking with unusual sharpness, "yes, sir." in</p>
<p>a moment every one present was watching the scene, beginning to smile as they saw mires start with suspicious alacrity</p>
<p>toward the wheels. some of the men, in order to get as good a view as possible of the expected</p>
<p>exhibition, stationed themselves near at hand, having hard work to suppress their merriment in advance, "purty stout, air ye?" asked</p>
<p>mires, as he and iack stood by the wheels. "i never boasted of my strength," replied iack, beginning to wonder</p>
<p>why so much interest was being manifested over so slight a matter. his surprise was increased at that moment by</p>
<p>discovering fret offut among the spectators, his big mouth reaching almost from ear to ear with an idiotic grin. "come</p>
<p>to see the fun!" declared the latter, finding that he had been seen by iack. "i ll take this one,"</p>
<p>said mires, stooping over the nearest wheel which was half buried in dust and dirt. then, without any apparent effort,</p>
<p>the small sized workman raised the wheel to his shoulder and walked back from the direction whence they had come.</p>
<p>"now see the big gawk lift his!" exclaimed fret offut, who had somehow been let into the secret, still ignorant</p>
<p>of the deception being played upon him, iack north bent over to lift the remaining wheel, having seen mires carry</p>
<p>off the other wheel with comparative ease, iack naturally expected to lift the remaining one without trouble, his amazement may</p>
<p>be therefore understood when, at his first effort, he failed to move it an inch from the floor, it lay</p>
<p>there as solid as if bound down! his failure was the signal for fret offut to break out into a</p>
<p>loud laugh, which was instantly caught up by the workmen, until the whole building rang with the merriment. "baby." some</p>
<p>one cried. "see mires carry his. north ain t got the strength of a mouse!" by that time mires had</p>
<p>reached the opposite end of the shop, and was putting down his burden to turn and ioin in the outbursts</p>
<p>over the discomfiture of his young companion. iack had now awakened to the realization that he had been the easy</p>
<p>victim of a scheme to cast ridicule upon him. mires could never have carried away this wheel. the thought of</p>
<p>the trick which had been played upon him aroused all the latent energy he possessed. he did not believe the</p>
<p>wheel could weigh five hundred pounds, and if it did not he would lift it, as he believed he could.</p>
<p>thus, with the shouts and laughter of the spectators ringing in his ears, jack stooped for a second attempt to</p>
<p>accomplish what no one else had ever been able to do. "i ll grunt for you!" called offut in derision,</p>
<p>"spit on your hands!" said a workman. iack compressed his lips for a mighty effort, and his hands closed on</p>
<p>the rim of the wheel, while he concentrated every atom of strength he had for the herculean task. the cries</p>
<p>of the onlookers suddenly stopped as they saw, to their amazement, the ponderous obiect rise from the floor, slowly but</p>
<p>surely, until the young workman held it abreast of him. not a sound broke the deathlike stillness, save for the</p>
<p>crunching of his own footsteps, as iack north walked across the shop and dropped his burden upon the wheel mires</p>
<p>had placed there. a loud crash succeeded, the heavy iron wheel having broken the imitation into kindling wood and smashed</p>
<p>into the floor. the cries of derision were supplemented by loud calls of admiration, which rang through and through the</p>
<p>old building until a perfect din prevailed. fret offut waited to see no more, but stole away unobserved by the</p>
<p>stalwart iron workers, who crowded around their victorious companion with hearty congratulations, iack had won the friendship of nearly all</p>
<p>by his feat, while henshaw at once boasted of the act. mires, fancying that the laugh had been turned upon</p>
<p>him, and he was about right, allowed all of the bitterness of his sullen nature to be turned against the</p>
<p>young apprentice. in his wicked heart he vowed he would humiliate Jack in the eyes of his admirers in some</p>
<p>way and at some time. but no opportunity came for him, as month after month passed. jack showed a wonderfully</p>
<p>industrious nature, and he never seemed idle. when not at work he was studying some part of the ponderous machinery</p>
<p>about him, as if anxious to learn all there was to be known about it. the knowledge he thus obtained</p>
<p>was to be of inestimable value to him in the scenes to come, this trait of his pleased henshaw, who,</p>
<p>if a rough man, was honest in his intentions, and he caused iack s wages to be raised to seven</p>
<p>dollars a week. this was done in opposition to his assistant, who had taken a strange dislike to him, his</p>
<p>reasons for this will become apparent as we proceed. about that time iack was surprised to find that fret offut</p>
<p>had found employment in the building, though it was more as a helper than as a regular workman, his chief</p>
<p>task being to wheel the scraps of iron and waste material away and to wait upon the boss of</p>
