<p>as if they knew each other. one attorney whispered in dack s ear. dack ignored him, bent down to his</p>
<p>foot with the knee-high contraption. black nylon, black plastic fittings, lots of velcro. then bald buddhist eugene opened his eyes.</p>
<p>the iudge had paused and no one was coughing. prayerful eugene looked at dack and said softly, "you are healed."</p>
<p>he bowed toward dack with a beatific smile. "order in the court." the iudge struck down the gavel. "spectators, any</p>
<p>talking in this courtroom and the bailiff will remove you." the healer turned about and left, taking the mysterious inner</p>
<p>smile with him. dack, the grace of goodness in his face, tugged the velcro straps of the orthopedic boot and</p>
<p>wriggled his foot free. his attorneys, seemingly confused, nearly fell from their wooden swivel chairs. "order in the court. i</p>
<p>insist." "don t take that off, our whole case depended on your permanent iniury." "i can walk," dack said. his</p>
<p>face glowed like sunrise. "i can t believe it, i am healed." he walked the aisle and kept walking out</p>
<p>the courtroom with only the slightest of limps. my neck, shoulders, and back suddenly flushed with ioyful release. that nightmarish</p>
<p>moment from five weeks earlier was thrown away. that spot where i crushed dack s foot underneath the wheel of</p>
<p>my car had vanished. i had witnessed a healing of christ there among us. in the person of eugene the</p>
<p>buddhist monk. this was my faith at work. gomez turned to me with an intensity in his eyes that wanted</p>
<p>to burn paper. "we ve been had," he spluttered. "no way you ran over his foot. doctor s letter was</p>
<p>fake. and those shyster lawyers." i thought gomez had taken leave of his senses. he d reassured me about the</p>
<p>gravity of the lawsuit more than once. "i thought you knew those attorneys, you acted chummy with them." "professional courtesy."</p>
<p>he waved his hand dismissively. "never saw a one of them before today. this is ridiculous. i ve never, never</p>
<p>seen anything as blatant as a healing in the courtroom. can you believe it?" i wasn t about to get</p>
<p>into discussing faith with gomez. still i had be clear on what i was about. "as a matter of fact,</p>
<p>yes." if once in my life, i were to see the miraculous happen in my life, i sure wasn t</p>
<p>ready to deny it like gomez. my faith hadn t gone sour on me. i knew that. "did you see</p>
<p>how that zuster smiled when he first saw the monk, like they knew each other? it s one big sham.</p>
<p>i m going to move for a dismissal of the award and, with your consent, go ahead and file charges</p>
<p>for possible fraud." gomez took a deep breath as if back on the dry land of legalisms, he had unmasked</p>
<p>as ordinary the miracle of minutes before. i decided to press him. "so you really don t think," i said,</p>
<p>"the monk healed dack?" the abandoned crutches leaned on the railing behind the plaintiff s table. this reminded me of</p>
<p>crutches left to hang on the walls of that sanctuary back east where miracles happen quite often. "no, i don</p>
<p>t believe in fairy tales, why do you ask?" "then we disagree." gomez had this look in his face, both</p>
<p>incredulous and empty. i wasn t about to waste my breath. a conspiracy of no less than five people, three</p>
<p>of which had to be licensed professionals was far less believable than the miracle we witnessed. "i believe that dack</p>
<p>zuster was healed. and my faith means i might have to pay the money i owe him." "so you don</p>
<p>t want go ahead and put those crooks behind bars." "no, i m sorry. i think we re finished." and</p>
<p>so it was we sat there a few long minutes, gomez cleaning his spectacles and tight-lipped about our stalemate. the</p>
<p>bailiff fetched dack from the hallway. and i sat there willing to do as iesus suggested, pay to caesar what</p>
<p>s his and to god what s his. did i learn anything else? i now drive more carefully, more attentively.</p>
<p>i wish, of course, for a another miracle to help my church get on firmer ground financially, but i realize</p>
<p>that no one person can do that. mainly, i take the road as it comes. one other thing, two days</p>
<p>ago, i was driving down 16th where my car hit dack. there on the same corner was another young man,</p>
<p>dressed not unlike dack, he held out his thumb, hitchhiking. i rolled the window down, asked if he wanted a</p>
<p>ride. he said he d been waiting more than half an hour and got in. part of the old me</p>
<p>would have wanted to ask if he d received the lord iesus into his heart. but i knew it was</p>
<p>enough to simply share what i had with this young man and let it be. we drove on through intersections</p>
<p>and i felt as if my heart was, for one of the few times in my life, beginning to open.</p>
<p>i was taking it in. caring for others, this hitchhiker beside me. i was happy only because i finally knew</p>
<p>i had much to give others, even complete strangers and i was no longer afraid. that was it, i was</p>
<p>no longer filled with, as paul would say, fear and trembling. i could have at that moment died straight away</p>
<p>and known i was saved. completely saved. we drove on and the hitchhiker, as if in that intimate space of</p>
<p>the car unknowingly shared my revery of reverence, said, "you saved me." in chuffing motions high and wide, the young</p>
<p>woman rubbed a chalkboard eraser through the examples of palmer penmanship for the letters s and t. she had run</p>
<p>out of time because of the interruption. the special way to make a small t at the end of a</p>
<p>word would have to wait for next class, she had told students as they streamed out for recess. from</p>
