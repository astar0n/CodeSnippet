<p>his horse in riding round in quest of one, for we have a bag of truffles, and nought to eat with them. never have i seen such locusts</p>
<p>as this vanguard of ours. not a pullet shall we see until we are in front of therm; so i shall leave my winchester runagates to the care</p>
<p>of the provost-marshal, and i shall hie south with you, nigel, with my truffles at my saddle-bow." "oliver, oliver, i know you over-well," said sir nigel, shaking his</p>
<p>head, and the two old soldiers rode off together to their pavilion. to the south of pampeluna in the kingdom of navarre there stretched a high table-land, rising</p>
<p>into bare, sterile hills, brown or gray in color, and strewn with huge boulders of granite. on the gascon side of the great mountains there had been running</p>
<p>streams, meadows, forests, and little nestling villages. here, on the contrary, were nothing but naked rocks, poor pasture, and savage, stone-strewn wastes, gloomy defiles or barrancas intersected this</p>
<p>wild country with mountain torrents dashing and foaming between their rugged sides. the clatter of waters, the scream of the eagle, and the howling of wolves the only</p>
<p>sounds which broke upon the silence in that dreary and inhospitable region, through this wild country it was that sir nigel and his company pushed their way, riding</p>
<p>at times through vast Vefiles where the brown, gnarled cliffs shot up on either side of them, and the sky was but a long winding blue slit between</p>
<p>the clustering lines of box which fringed the lips of the precipices; or, again leading their horses along the narrow and rocky paths worn by the muleteers upon</p>
<p>the edges of the chasm, where under their very elbows they could see the white streak which marked the gave which foamed a thousand feet below them. so</p>
<p>for two days they pushed their way through the wild places of navarre, past fuente, over the rapid ega, through estella, until upon a winter s evening the</p>
<p>mountains fell away from in front of them, and they saw the broad blue ebro curving betwixt its double line or homesteads and of villages. the fishers of</p>
<p>viana were aroused that night by rough voices speaking in a strange tongue, and ere morning sir nigel and his men had ferried the river and were safe</p>
<p>upon the land of spain. all the next day they lay in a pine wood near to the town of logrono, resting their horses and taking counsel as</p>
<p>to what they should do. sir nigel had with him sir william felton, sir oliver buttesthorn, stout old sir simon burley, the scotch knight- errant, the earl of</p>
<p>angus, and sir richard causton, all accounted among the bravest knights in the army, together with sixty veteran men-at-arms, and three hundred and twenty archers. spies had been</p>
<p>sent out in the morning, and returned after nightfall to say that the king of spain was encamped some fourteen miles off in the direction of burgos, having</p>
<p>with him twenty thousand horse and forty-five thousand foot. a dry-wood fire had been lit, and round this the leaders crouched, the glare beating upon their rugged faces,</p>
<p>while the hardy archers lounged and chatted amid the tethered horses, while they munched their scanty provisions. "for my part," said sir simon burley, "i am of opinion</p>
<p>that we have already done that which we have come for. for do we not now know where the king is, and how great a following he hath,</p>
<p>which was the end of our /Â°ourney." "true," answered sir william felton, "but i have come on this venture because it is a long time since i have</p>
<p>broken a spear in war, and, certes, i shall not go back until i have run a course with some cavalier of spain. let those go back who</p>
<p>will, but i must see more of these spaniards ere i turn." "i will not leave you, sir william," returned sir simon burley," "and yet, as an old</p>
<p>soldier and one who hath seen much of war, i cannot but think that it is an ill thing for four hundred men to find themselves between an</p>
<p>army of sixty thousand on the one side and a broad river on the other." "yet," said sir richard causton, "we cannot for the honor of england go</p>
<p>back without a blow struck." "nor for the honor of scotland either," cried the earl of angus, "by saint andrew! i wish that i may never set eyes</p>
<p>upon the Water of leith again, if i pluck my horse s bridle ere i have seen this camp of theirs," "by saint paul! you have spoken very</p>
<p>well," said sir nigel, "and i have always heard that there were very worthy gentlemen among the scots, and fine skirmishing to be had upon their border, bethink</p>
<p>you, sir simon, that we have this news from the lips of common spies, who can scarce tell us as much of the enemy and of his forces</p>
<p>as the prince would wish to hear." "you are the leader in this venture, sir nigel," the other answered, "and i do but ride under your banner."</p>
