<p>daniel asked. "it looks too thick to be light pollution, and smells odd. i ve never smelled this smell before,"</p>
<p>mr. sanders said. "this is too weird  is this the sanctuary rurik spoke of: an empty wilderness?" amber asked.</p>
<p>"congratulations, and thank you for opening the door for me and my research team." a familiar voice spoke from behind</p>
<p>them. the four turned around and saw doctor roberts standing at the end of the bridge with a group of</p>
<p>armed men directing their weapons at them. "your uncle has enough findings to his name, miss mcclean. i ll field</p>
<p>this one if you don t mind." "fool!" larry shepherd growled at him. "you haven t the first clue of</p>
<p>what we ve discovered here today!" "no, but i m going to be the one to figure it out and</p>
<p>tell the world what it is. not any of you, and especially not professor mcclean. it s good to see</p>
<p>you again, mr. sanders. i hope life is treating you well." "not well enough, philip," mr. sanders murmured. "of course,</p>
<p>things are bound to look up someday." doctor roberts clapped. "here s how this is going to go. you four</p>
<p>will stay here, while i and my men continue forward. sound good." fabulous." larry shepherd, daniel davis, amber mcclean and</p>
<p>mr. sanders stood against the wall out of the way as doctor roberts and his crew climbed down a rope</p>
<p>and entered the valley beyond the cliff. two of his men remained behind to watch the four and make sure</p>
<p>they didn t follow. the guards paced the walkway before the ledge, sometimes turning their backs to the hostages. amber</p>
<p>leaned over to mr. sanders next to her and whispered, "make a distraction. i have a plan." mr. sanders nodded</p>
<p>and sighed loudly. the guards immediately turned their attention to him. "i have a splitting headache. neither of you would</p>
<p>happen to have an aspirin on you, perhaps? no? sorry," he chuckled. "i get nervous under high pressure situations. sometimes</p>
<p>i faint. ohure times i begin vomiting violently. if i could just get an aspirin, i d be fine." the</p>
<p>two glanced at one anohure quizzically. mr. sanders shrugged to amber. after a few minutes, he sighed again and collapsed</p>
<p>to his knees. "stand up!" one of the {bards shouted and pointed the muzzle of his gun at mr. sanders.</p>
<p>"i just... need some fresh air." mr. sanders clutched his chest. as one of the guards approached him, he grabbed</p>
<p>the gun from him and put the guard into a headlock. going with the plan in fluid motion, larry shepherd</p>
<p>pushed the first guard down and then turned and ran back toward the entrance. during this struggle, amber snagged daniel</p>
<p>s sleeve and pulled him backward. they retreated through the corridor, through the doorway and down the spiral staircase back</p>
<p>to where they had left the quasar lite. - when travis woke the next morning to the sound of something</p>
<p>at the door, he saw uncle dave peering in from the doorway. a look of concern filled his face. travis</p>
<p>met his eye. he held his finger up to his lips. for a moment, travis thought dan or miles had</p>
<p>curled up next to him and started snoring, but when he looked over he saw the brindle brown, white and</p>
<p>5/WOW Coloring of the puma s pelt. travis stifled a scream. it was practically on top of him. he looked</p>
<p>to uncle dave who shook his head and quietly held up anohure steak. miles, who was still asleep, rolled over</p>
<p>and kicked the mountain lion in the hip. uncle dave grimaced, squeezing his eyes closed. the cat s slow, rhythmic</p>
<p>breathing ceased for a moment before it continued again. pat snored from his bed. dan roused next. he took a</p>
<p>deep breath, lifted his head of messy, morning hair and saw the mountain lion. "wassup, cat." he murmured sleepily, rolled</p>
<p>onto his ohure side, and fell back to sleep. uncle dave, still holding the steak, breathed a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>he turned around and disappeared for a minute. uncle dave returned with a notepad in hand. he scribbled on the</p>
<p>page, and then turned it to travis so he could read. "just relax. don t do anything sudden, and stay</p>
<p>calm. don t touch it. let it feel like it s in control." travis nodded, physically trying to calm himself.</p>
<p>he could hear his heart thumping wildly in his chest, aching in its extremity. uncle dave stuck his head in</p>
<p>the room and looked around. he did a double-take at a blue, spray-painted light-saber made out of pvc pipe hanging</p>
<p>over the doorway and grabbed it. he balanced the steak on the steel handle and extended it into the bedroom</p>
<p>slowly. the shadow of the steak on the light-saber crossed the mountain lion s back and made its way to</p>
<p>the cat s sleeping face. it took a deep breath. the creature groaned as it opened its eyes. uncle dave</p>
<p>pulled the steak back, nearly dropping it in his haste. the mountain lion slowly sat up and glared at uncle</p>
<p>dave, who started retreating down the hall so all the cat could see was the steak hovering in the passage.</p>
<p>the puma didn t seem very interested as it licked its fine black lips and wiggled its ears back and</p>
<p>forth to the sounds of the birds singing just outside pat s window. it must have licked its lips five</p>
<p>times before it fell into a bout of cleaning its paws and nails, its long pink tongue sliding down its</p>
<p>fur in its meticulous cleansing process. uncle dave gave a frustrated sigh from the hallway and slowly reintroduced the steak</p>
<p>into the room. the mountain lion saw it this time and rose to all fours. it stretched and arched its</p>
<p>back, allowing the fur riding down its spine to raise straight up. the puma dropped into a long, lanky stride</p>
<p>between the boys. it stepped on its bad paw and limped the rest of the way, following uncle dave</p>
