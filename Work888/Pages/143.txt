<p>us has this quest. That is why we are called aspirants, or sadhaka, meaning not complacent. we want each step</p>
<p>to find us farther than the last. The dream you had ten years ago may have been realized by now.</p>
<p>You find that you want something more. You want to go further. This "more" is the nature of that upward-moving</p>
<p>element. wherever you go and whatever you receive, that "more" is there. It will remain till the last, till you</p>
<p>reach the best. You have not reached the height yet; that is why that longing is there. So meditate on</p>
<p>suchi and ask yourself, "what is moving upward in me? what is the pure, unique essence of life? Let me</p>
<p>not confuse that with other elements which are composing and decomposing." Investigate, "what is the quality of my thoughts and</p>
<p>emotions? what is the frequency of my Vibrations? Are they lifting me up or taking me down? Are they increasing</p>
<p>the heaviness in me, or are they focused on revealing my light?" It is very important to have a sense</p>
<p>of discrimination to differentiate between these two. without this discriminating sense, we run the risk of identifying our pure essence</p>
<p>with the matter-laden coverings weighing it down. without the light of awareness, the mind deludes us. That is the influence</p>
<p>of the hypnotic spell. we allow ourselves to live without the experience of who we really are. This is self-</p>
<p>deception. There is no outside deceiver who can fool you more than your own inaccurate thinking you may think, "I</p>
<p>have everything. I can buy any thing I want. I am happy." But unexpectedly sorrow creeps in and all of</p>
<p>a sudden your mood is depressed. So we take a little time to investigate our inertia, the heaviness which does</p>
<p>not allow us to move. we see clearly what is covered with shadow, sorrow, and heavy desires. Otherwise, the negative</p>
<p>vibrations which are the substance of those gravitating tendencies in us will continue to attract karmas or particles of matter</p>
<p>to us and obscure our vision. As long as we allow our thoughts to run wild and unchecked, our mind</p>
<p>will be subjected to the continuing influx of these undesirable elements. Rather than suppress your thoughts, watch them. Do you</p>
<p>want to overcome sorrow and guilt? Then observe the way in which sorrow works. Notice how it has a way</p>
<p>of waiting in the corner a little distance away and then how it tackles you all of a sudden without</p>
<p>giving you a chance to think. Your discriminatory sense itself tends to get covered. One minute you were blossoming with</p>
<p>a smile, the next minute you are sad and morose. what has happened? where has your happiness gone? where was</p>
<p>this depressed mood waiting? It was waiting in the mind. Once sorrow invades you, you have no strength to overcome</p>
<p>it. You sink lower and lower. You might have noticed that when you are under the clouds of sadness, even</p>
<p>if you recite a mantra and pray, you are sometimes not able to lift yourself out of that feeling. In</p>
<p>those moments, where is all the wisdom? It remains in a corner. Though our heads are filled with a lot</p>
<p>of quotations, do we use them when we are under the influence of sorrow? we do not. Though we have</p>
<p>read books on how to be happy, do they help us? Apparently not. It seems that we are only able</p>
<p>to use their wisdom when we are in a good mood. It is most important that we learn to call</p>
<p>upon our knowledge and insights to sustain us when we are in a low state. we must remember them, call</p>
<p>them forth, and put them to use. why don t we use our knowledge? Because intellectual information and emotional feeling</p>
<p>work in different directions. For example, intellectually we know that anyone who comes into our life is eventually going to</p>
<p>go. we are aware that all are on a Journey, coming and going, but when that event happens in our</p>
<p>life, how do we take it? Intellectually we understand, but emotionally what is our reaction? Meditation helps us bring that</p>
<p>knowledge into our feeling. Experiencing our feeling, we change our perception. Changing our perception, we become ready to meet any</p>
<p>challenge. Nothing comes as a shock or a surprise. Understanding has been absorbed into our experience . The wise person</p>
<p>lives in the world, but not of it. He lies with complete awareness. There is a Zen story which illustrates</p>
<p>this. Once there was a famous swordsman who was on his deathbed when his son asked him, "what is your</p>
<p>last wish, father?" His father answered, "Oh, Mataiura, my son, I had a dream to see you become the greatest</p>
<p>of swordsmen, but I failed." Mataiura told him, "And I also wanted to become that, but the right teacher could</p>
<p>not be found, and you also had no time to teach me." Then his father said, "This wish is so</p>
<p>strong that I am going to live three more years to see that it is fulfilled. Though I am on</p>
<p>my deathbed, I shall not die." So his son asked, "who shall be my teacher?" His father sent him to</p>
<p>Banzo, who was known to be the master at that time. The boy went to 8anzo and bowed and said,</p>
<p>"I want to study with you and become a skilled swordsman. I am willing to devote myself completely to this</p>
<p>task. How long will it take for me to master the art" The master answered, "Twelve years." "Twelve years?" The</p>
<p>boy was incredulous. "Suppose I use every moment of my day and allow for only three hours sleep, then how</p>
<p>long will it take?" "Then it may take twenty years!" The boy did not understand . So the master explained,</p>
<p>"One who is in haste and keeps his eye only on the result and not on the process gets no</p>
<p>result. I teach not for result but for life. Master swordsmanship means to be vigilant, to know how not to</p>
<p>kill and yet how to protect oneself. You must know that in the sword there is no friendly edge. If</p>
<p>I teach only for result, you will be sliced. what for? I care more for the welfare of your life."</p>
<p>Now the boy understood. He told the master, "Sir, I drop the idea of timing. I request that you accept</p>
<p>me as your student. I will become a vessel to receive wisdom from you." From that day, he was accepted</p>
<p>as the master s student Now that his mind was calm, he was to receive a special training in</p>
