<p>of monsters - Frankenstein, the Golem - and androids or anthropoids. Their behavior is more "humane" than the humans around them. This,</p>
<p>perhaps, is what really sets humans apart: their behavioral unpredictability. "it is yielded by the interaction between Mankind s underlying immutable genetically-determined</p>
<p>nature - and Man s kaleidoscopically changing environments, The (onstructivists even claim that Human Nature is a mere cultural artefact, Sociobiologists, on</p>
<p>the other hand, are determinists. They believe that human nature - being the inevitable and inexorable outcome of our bestial ancestry -</p>
<p>cannot be the subject of moral iudgment. An improved Turing Test would look for baffling and erratic patterns of misbehavior to identify</p>
<p>humans. Pico della Mirandola wrote in "Oration on the Dignity of Man" that Man was born without a form and can mould</p>
<p>and transform - actually, create - himself at will. Existence precedes essence, said the Existentialists centuries later. The one defining human characteristic</p>
<p>may be our awareness of our mortality. The automatically triggered, "fight or flight", battle for survival is common to all living things</p>
<p>(and to appropriately programmed machines). Not so the catalytic effects of imminent death, These are uniquely human, The appreciation of the fleeting</p>
<p>translates into aesthetics, the uniqueness of our ephemeral life breeds morality, and the scarcity of time gives rise to ambition and creativity,</p>
<p>"in an infinite life, everything materializes at one time or another, so the concept of choice is spurious, The realization of our</p>
<p>finiteness forces us to choose among alternatives. This act of selection is predicated upon the existence of "free will". Animals and machines</p>
<p>are thought to be devoid of choice, slaves to their genetic or human programming. Yet, all these answers to the question: "what</p>
<p>does it mean to be human" - are lacking. The set of attributes we designate as human is sub/"ect to profound alteration.</p>
<p>Drugs, neuroscience, introspection, and experience all cause irreversible changes in these traits and characteristics. The accumulation of these changes can lead, in</p>
<p>principle, to the emergence of new properties, or to the abolition of old ones. Animals and machines are not supposed to possess</p>
<p>free will or exercise it. what, then, about fusions of machines and humans (bionics)? At which point does a human turn into</p>
<p>a machine? And why should we assume that free will ceases to exist at that - rather arbitrary - point? "introspection -</p>
<p>the ability to construct self-referential and recursive models of the world - is supposed to be a uniquely human quality. what about</p>
<p>introspective machines? Surely, say the critics, such machines are PROGRAMMED to introspect, as opposed to humans, To qualify as introspection, it must</p>
<p>be T-IWLLED, they continue. Yet, if introspection is willed - wt-{O wills it? Self-willed introspection leads to infinite regression and formal logical</p>
<p>paradoxes. Moreover, the notion - if not the formal concept - of "human" rests on many hidden assumptions and conventions. Political correctness</p>
<p>notwithstanding - why presume that men and women {or different races) are identically human? Aristotle thought they were not, A lot separates</p>
<p>males from females - genetically (both genotype and phenotype} and environmentally (culturally). what is common to these two sub-species that makes them</p>
<p>both "human"." Can we conceive of a human without body (i.e., a Platonian Form, or soul)? Aristotle and Thomas Aquinas think not,</p>
<p>A soul has no existence separate from the body. A machine-supported energy field with mental states similar to ours today - would</p>
<p>it be considered human? what about someone in a state of coma - is he or she {or it) fully human? Is</p>
<p>a new born baby human - or, at least, fully human - and, if so, in which sense? what about a future</p>
<p>human race - whose features would be unrecognizable to us? Machine-based intelligence - would it be thought of as human? "I)" yes,</p>
<p>when would it be considered human? "In all these deliberations, we may be confusing "human" with "person", The former is a private</p>
<p>case of the latter. Locke s person is a moral agent, a being responsible for its actions, "It is constituted by the</p>
<p>continuity of its mental states accessible to introspection, Locke s is a functional definition. Vt readily accommodates non-human persons (machines, energy matrices}</p>
<p>if the functional conditions are satisfied, Thus, an android which meets the prescribed requirements is more human than a brain dead person,</p>
<p>Descartes obiection that one cannot specify conditions of singularity and identity over time for disembodied souls is right only if we assume</p>
<p>that such "souls" possess no energy. A bodiless intelligent energy matrix which maintains its form and identity over time is conceivable, certain</p>
<p>AI and genetic software programs already do it. Strawson is Cartesian and ktantian in his definition of a "person" as a "primitive".</p>
<p>80th the corporeal predicates and those pertaining to mental states apply equally, simultaneously, and inseparably to all the individuals of that type</p>
<p>of entity. Human beings are one such entity. Some, like wiggins, limit the list of possible persons to animals - but this</p>
<p>is far from rigorously necessary and is unduly restrictive. The truth is probably in a synthesis: A person is any type of</p>
<p>fundamental and irreducible entity whose typical physical individuals (i.e., members) are capable of continuously experiencing a range of states of consciousness and</p>
<p>permanently having a list of psychological attributes. This definition allows for non-animal persons and recognizes the personhood of a brain damaged human</p>
<p>{"capable of experiencing"J, It also incorporates Locke s view of humans as possessing an ontological status similar to "clubs" or "nations" -</p>
<p>their personal identity consists of a variety of interconnected psychological continuities. The Encroachment of the Public By: Dr, Sam Vaknin Also Read</p>

<p>As Aristotle and ilohn Stuart Mill observed, the private sphere sets limits, both normative and empirical, to the rights, powers, and obligations</p>
<p>of Others, The myriad forms of undue invasion of the private sphere - such as rape, burglary, or eavesdropping - are all</p>
<p>crimes. Even the state - this monopolist of legal violence - respects these boundaries. when it fails to honor the distinction between</p>
<p>public and private - when it is authoritarian or totalitarian - it loses its legitimacy. Alas, this vital separation of realms is</p>
<p>eroding fast, "in theory, private life is insulated and shielded from social pressures, the ambit of norms and laws, and even the</p>
<p>strictures of public morality. Reality, though, is different. The encroachment of the public is inexorable and, probably, irreversible. The individual is forced</p>
<p>to share, consent to, or merely obey a panoply of laws, norms, and regulations not only in his or her relationships with</p>
<p>others - but also when solitary. Failure to comply - and to be seen to be conforming - leads to dire consequences,</p>
<p>"in a morbid twist, public morality is now synonymous with social orthodoxy, political authority, and the exercise of police powers. The quiddity,</p>
<p>remit, and attendant rights of the private sphere are now determined publicly, by the state, "in the modern world , privacy -</p>
<p>the freedom to withhold or divulge information - and autonomy - the liberty to act in certain ways when not in public</p>
<p>- are illusory in that their scope and essence are ever-shifting, reversible, and culture-dependent. They both are perceived as public concessions</p>
