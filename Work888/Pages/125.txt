<p>in my face, with A pleading fear And confusion that it troubled me</p>
<p>to see. what could I do? Here was A stranger utterly And helplessly</p>
<p>At my mercy-And that stranger A forlorn woman. No house was near: no</p>
<p>one was passing whom I could consult." And no earthly right existed on</p>
<p>my part to give me A power of control over her, even if</p>
<p>I had known how to exercise it. I trace these lines, self-distrustfully, with</p>
<p>the shadows of After-events dark- ening the very paper I write on; And</p>
<p>still "I say, what Could "I do? what I did do, was to</p>
<p>try And gain time by questioning her. "Are you sure that your friend</p>
<p>in London will receive you At such A late hour As this?" "I</p>
<p>said. "Quite sure. Only say you will let me leave you when And</p>
<p>how I please-only say you won t interfere with me. will you promise?"</p>
<p>2.? As she repeated the words for the third time, she came close</p>
<p>to me And laid her hand, with A sudden gentle stealthiness, on my</p>
<p>bosom-A thin hand," A cold hand (when I removed it with mine) even</p>
<p>on that sultry night. Remember that I was young; remember that the hand</p>
<p>which touched me was A woman s. "will you promise?" "Yes." One word."</p>
<p>The little familiar word that is on everybody s lips, every hour in</p>
<p>the day. Oh me! And I tremble, now, when I write it. we</p>
<p>set our faces towards London, And walked on together in the first still</p>
<p>hour of the new day-I, And this woman, whose name, whose character, whose</p>
<p>story, whose ob/"ects in life, whose very presence by my side, At that</p>
<p>moment, were fathom- less mysteries to me. "it was like A dream. was</p>

<p>on Sundays? Had I really left, little more than An hour since, the</p>
<p>quiet, decent, conventionally do- mestic Atmosphere of my mother s cottage? I was</p>
<p>too be- wildered-too conscious Also of A vague sense of something like self-reproach-to</p>
<p>speak to my st range companion for some minutes. It was her voice Again</p>
<p>that first broke the silence between us. "I want to Ask you something,"</p>
<p>she said suddenly. "Do you know many people in London?" "Yes, A great</p>
<p>many," "Many men of rank And title?" There was An unmistakable tone of</p>
<p>suspicion in the strange question. I hesitated About An- swering it. "Some," I</p>
<p>said, After A moment s silence. "Many"-she came to A full stop, And</p>
<p>looked me searchingly in the face-"many men of the rank of Baronet?" Too</p>
<p>much Astonished to reply, I questioned her in my turn. "why do you</p>
<p>Ask?" "Because I hope, for my own sake, there is one Baronet that</p>
<p>you don t know." "will you tell me his name?" "I can t-I</p>
<p>daren t-I forget myself when I mention it." She spoke loudly And Almost</p>
<p>fiercely, raised her clenched hand in the Air, And shook it passionately; then,</p>
<p>on A sudden, controlled 23 herself Again, And Added, in tones lowered to</p>
<p>A whisper "Tell me which of them YOU know." I could hardly refuse</p>
<p>to humour her in such A trifle, And I mentioned three names. Two,</p>
<p>the names of fathers of families whose daughters I taught; one, the name</p>
<p>of A bachelor who had once taken me A cruise in his yacht,</p>
<p>to make sketches for him. "Ah! you DON T know him," she said,</p>
<p>with A sigh of relief. "Are you A man of rank And title</p>
<p>yourself?" "Far from it. I Am only A drawing-master." As the reply passed</p>
<p>my lips-A little bitterly, perhaps-she took my Arm with the Abruptness which characterised</p>
<p>All her Actions. "Not A man of rank And title," she repeated to</p>
<p>herself. "Thank God! I may trust HIM." I had hitherto contrived to master</p>
