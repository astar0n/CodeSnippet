<p>is tainted by a history of recurrent ethnocide and genocide and thwarted by the dogma of egalitarianism. The {legitimate} question "are all</p>
<p>races equal" thus becomes a private case of the (no less legitimate) "are all men equal". To ask "can races co-exist peacefully"</p>
<p>is thus to embark on the slippery slope to slavery and Auschwitz. These historical echoes and the overweening imposition of political correctness</p>
<p>prevent any meaningful - let alone scientific - discourse. The irony is that "race" - or at least race as determined by</p>
<p>skin color - is a distinctly unscientific concept, concerned more with appearances (i.e., the color of one s skin, the shape of</p>
<p>one s head or hair}, common history, and social politics - than strictly with heredity, Dr, Richard Lewontin, a Harvard geneticist, noted</p>
<p>in his work in the 1II0s that the popularity of the idea of race is an "indication of the power of socioeconomically</p>
<p>based ideology over the supposed objectivity of knowledge." Still, many human classificatory traits are concordant. Different taxonomic criteria conjure up different "races"</p>
<p>- but also real races. As Cambridge University statistician, A. w. F. Edwards, observed in 2003, certain traits and features do tend</p>
<p>to cluster and positively correlate (dark skinned people do tend to have specific shapes of noses, skulls, eyes, bodies, and hair, for</p>
<p>instance}. ?Q is a similarly contentious construct, but it is stable and does predict academic achievement effectively. Granted, racist-sounding claims may be</p>
<p>as unfounded as claims about racial equality. Still, while the former are treated as an abomination - the latter are accorded academic</p>
<p>respectability and scientific scrutiny. Consider these two hypotheses: 1. That the II (or any other measurable trait) of a given race or</p>
<p>ethnic group is hereditarily determined (i.e., that skin color and II - or another measurable trait - are concordant) and is strongly</p>
<p>correlated with certain types of behavior, life accomplishments, and social status. 2. That the "R2 {or any other quantifiable trait) of a</p>
<p>given race or "ethnic group" is the outcome of social and economic circumstances and even if strongly correlated with behavior patterns, academic</p>
<p>or other achievements, and social status - which is disputable - is amenable to "social engineering". Both theories are falsifiable and both</p>
<p>deserve serious, unbiased, study. That we choose to ignore the first and substantiate the second demonstrates the pernicious and corrupting effect of</p>
<p>political correctness. Claims of the type "trait A and trait B are concordant" should be investigated by scientists, regardless of how politically</p>
<p>incorrect they are. Not so claims of the type "people with trait A are..." or "people with trait A do...". These should</p>
<p>be decried as racist tripe. Thus, medical research shows the statement "The traits of being an Ashkenazi tfew (A) and suffering from</p>
<p>Tay-Sachs induced idiocy (8) are concordant in 1 of every 2500 cases" is true, The statements "people who are ï¬‚ews (i.e,, with</p>
<p>trait A) are {narcissists}", or "people who are iews (i.e., with trait A) do this: they drink the blood of innocent Christian</p>
<p>children during the Passover rites" - are vile racist and paranoid statements. People are not created equal. Human diversity - a taboo</p>
<p>topic - is a cause for celebration. "it is important to study and ascertain what are the respective contributions of nature and</p>
<p>nurture to the way people - individuals and groups - grow, develop, and mature. In the pursuit of this invaluable and essential</p>
<p>knowledge, taboos are dangerously counter-productive. V. Moral Relativism Protagoras, the Greek Sophist, was the first to notice that ethical codes are culture-dependent</p>
<p>and vary in different societies, economies, and geographies. The pragmatist believe that what is right is merely what society thinks is right</p>
<p>at any given moment. Good and evil are not immutable. No moral principle - and taboos are moral principles - is universally</p>
<p>and eternally true and valid. Morality applies within cultures but not across them. But ethical or cultural relativism and the various schools</p>
<p>of pragmatism ignore the fact that certain ethical percepts - probably grounded in human nature - do appear to be universal and</p>
<p>ancient. Fairness, veracity, keeping promises, moral hierarchy - permeate all the cultures we have come to know. Nor can certain moral tenets</p>
<p>be explained away as mere expressions of emotions or behavioral prescriptions - devoid of cognitive content, logic, and a relatedness to certain</p>
<p>facts. Still, it is easy to prove that most taboos are, indeed, relative. "Incest, suicide, feticide, infanticide, parricide, ethnocide, genocide, genital mutilation,</p>
<p>social castes, and adultery are normative in certain cultures - and strictly proscribed in others. Taboos are pragmatic moral principles. They derive</p>
<p>their validity from their efficacy. They are observed because they work, because they yield solutions and provide results. They disappear or are</p>
<p>transformed when no longer useful. Vncest is likely to be tolerated in a world with limited possibilities for procreation. Suicide is bound</p>
<p>to be encouraged in a society suffering from extreme scarcity of resources and over-population. Ethnocentrism, racism and xenophobia will inevitably rear their</p>
<p>ugly heads again in anomic circumstances. None of these taboos is unassailable. None of them reflects some obiective truth, independent of culture</p>
<p>and circumstances. They are convenient conventions, workable principles, and regulatory mechanisms - nothing more. That scholars are frantically trying to convince us</p>
<p>otherwise - or to exclude such a discussion altogether - is a sign of the growing disintegration of our weakening society. Technology,</p>
<p>Philosophy of "However far modern science and technology have fallen short of their inherent possibilities, they have taught mankind at least one</p>
<p>lesson: Nothing is impossible. Today, the degradation of the inner life is symbolized by the fact that the only place sacred from</p>
<p>interruption is the private toilet. By his very success in inventing laboursaving devices, modern man has manufactured an abyss of boredom that</p>
<p>only the privileged classes in earlier civilizations have ever fathomed. For most Americans, progress means accepting what is new because it is</p>
<p>new, and discarding what is old because it is old. "I would die happy if I knew that on my tombstone could</p>
<p>be written these words, "This man was an absolute fool. None of the disastrous things that he reluctantly predicted ever came to</p>
<p>pass!" Lewis Mumford (18I5-1II0) 1. Is it meaningful to discuss technology separate from life, as opposed to life, or compared to life?</p>
<p>I5 it not the inevitable product of life, a determinant of life and part of its definition? Francis Bacon and, centuries later,</p>
<p>the visionary Ernst tcapp, thought of technology as a means to conquer and master nature - an expression of the classic dichotomy</p>
<p>between observer and observed, But there could be other ways of looking at it (consider, for instance, the seminal work of Friedrich</p>
<p>Dessauer), /<app was the first to talk of technology as "organ projection" (preceding McLuhan by more than a century). Freud wrote in</p>
<p>"Civilization and its Discontents": "Man has, as it were, become a kind of prosthetic god. when he puts on all his auxiliary</p>
<p>organs he is truly magnificent: but those organs have not grown on to him and they still give him much trouble at</p>
<p>times." 2. On the whole, has technology contributed to human development or arrested it? 3. Even if we accept that technology is</p>
<p>alien to life, a foreign implant and a potential menace - what frame of reference can accommodate the new convergence between</p>
