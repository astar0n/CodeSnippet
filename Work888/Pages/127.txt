<p>the 2I of 865 Great Expectations mound beyond the ditch, when I saw</p>
<p>the man sitting before me. His back was towards me, and he had</p>
<p>his arms folded, and was nodding forward, heavy with sleep. I thought he</p>
<p>would be more glad if I came upon him with his breakfast, in</p>
<p>that unexpected manner, so I went forward softly and touched him on the</p>
<p>shoulder. He instantly iumped up, and it was not the same man, but</p>
<p>another man! And yet this man was dressed in coarse grey, too, and</p>
<p>had a great iron on his leg, and was lame, and hoarse, and</p>
<p>cold, and Was everything that the other man was; except that he had</p>
<p>not the same face, and had a flat broad- brimmed low-crowned felt that</p>
<p>on. All this, I saw in a moment, for I had only a</p>
<p>moment to see it in: he swore an oath at me, made a</p>
<p>hit at me - it was a round weak blow that missed me</p>
<p>and almost knocked himself down, for it made him stumble - and then</p>
<p>he ran into the mist, stumbling twice as he went, and I lost</p>
<p>him. It s the young man! I thought, feeling my heart shoot as</p>
<p>I identified him. I dare say I should have felt a pain in</p>
<p>my liver, too, if I had known where it was. I was soon</p>
<p>at the Battery, after that, and there was the right man-hugging himself and</p>
<p>limping to and fro, as if he had never all night left off</p>
<p>hugging and limping - waiting 28 of 865 Great Expectations for me, He</p>
<p>was awfully cold, to be sure. I half expected to see him drop</p>
<p>down before my face and die of deadly cold. His eyes looked so</p>
<p>awfully hungry, too, that when I handed him the file and he laid</p>
<p>it down on the grass, it occurred to me he would have tried</p>
<p>to eat it, if he had not seen my bundle. He did not</p>
<p>turn me upside down, this time, to get at what I had, but</p>
<p>left me right side upwards while I opened the bundle and emptied my</p>
<p>pockets. what s in the bottle, boy? said he. arandy, said I. He</p>
<p>was already handing mincemeat down his throat in the most curious manner -</p>
<p>more like a man who was putting it away somewhere in a violent</p>
<p>hurry, than a man who was eating it - but he left off</p>
<p>to take some of the liquor. He shivered all the while, so violently,</p>
<p>that it was quite as much as he could do to keep the</p>
<p>neck of the bottle between his teeth, without biting it off. I think</p>
<p>you have got the ague, said I. I m much of your opinion,</p>
<p>boy, said he. "it s bad about here, I told him. You ve</p>
<p>been lying out on the meshes, and they re dreadful aguish. Rheumatic too.</p>
<p>I ll eat my breakfast afore they re the death of me, said</p>
<p>he. I d do that, if I was going to be strung up</p>
<p>to that there 2I of 865 Great Expectations gallows as there is over</p>
<p>there, directly afterwards. I ll beat the shivers so far, I ll bet</p>
<p>you. He was gobbling mincemeat, meatbone, bread, cheese, and pork pie, all at</p>
<p>once: staring distrustfully while he did so at the mist all round us,</p>
<p>and often stopping - even stopping his jaws - to listen. Some real</p>
<p>or fancied sound, some clink upon the river or breathing of beast upon</p>
<p>the marsh, now gave him a start, and he said, suddenly: You re</p>
<p>not a deceiving imp? You brought no one with you? No, sir! No!</p>
<p>Nor giv no one the office to follow you? No! well, said he,</p>
<p>I believe you. You d be but a fierce .V"Â§ung hound indeed, if</p>
<p>at your time of life you could help to hunt a wretched</p>
