<p>a reduction in our numbers, This could be achieved benignly, for instance by colonizing space, or the ocean depths - both remote</p>
<p>and technologically unfeasible possibilities. Yet, the alternative is cataclysmic. Unintended wars, rampant disease, and lethal famines will ultimately trim our numbers -</p>
<p>no matter how noble our intentions and how diligent our efforts to curb them, Is this a bad thing." Not necessarily. To</p>
<p>my mind, even a Malthusian resolution is preferable to the alternative of slow decay, uniform impecuniosity, and perdition in instalments - an</p>
<p>alternative made inexorable by our collective irresponsibility and denial. Racing Down Eugenics and the Future of the Human Species By: Dr. Sam</p>
<p>Vaknin "It is clear that modern medicine has created a serious dilemma  "In the past, there were many children who never</p>
<p>survived - they succumbed to various diseases  But in a sense modern medicine has put natural selection out of Commission. Something</p>
<p>that has helped one individual over a serious illness can in the long run contribute to weakening the resistance of the whole</p>
<p>human race to certain diseases. "N we pay absolutely no attention to what is called hereditary hygiene, we could find ourselves facing</p>
<p>a degeneration of the human race. Mankind s hereditary potential for resisting serious disease will be weakened." illostein Gaarder in "Sophie s</p>
<p>world", a bestselling philosophy textbook for adolescents published in Oslo, Norway, in 1II1 and, afterwards, throughout the world, having been translated to</p>
<p>dozens of languages} The Nazis regarded the murder of the feeble-minded and the mentally insane - intended to purify the race and</p>
<p>maintain hereditary hygiene - as a form of euthanasia. German doctors were enthusiastic proponents of an eugenics movements rooted in 1Ith century</p>
<p>social Darwinism. Luke Gormally writes, in his essay "walton, Davies, and 8oyd" (published in "Euthanasia Examined - Ethical, Clinical, and Legal Perspectives"</p>
<p>ed. tlohn /<eown, Cambridge University Press, 1II5}: "when the iurist ktarl Binding and the psychiatrist Alfred Hoche published their tract The Permission</p>
<p>to Destroy Life that is Not worth Living in 1I20  their motive was to rid society of the human ballast and</p>
<p>enormous economic burden of care for the mentally ill, the handicapped, retarded and deformed children, and the incurably ill. But the reason</p>
<p>they invoked to justify the killing of human beings who fell into these categories was that the lives of such human beings</p>
<p>were not worth living , were devoid of value " It is this association with the hideous Nazi regime that gave eugenics</p>
<p>- a term coined by a relative of Charles Darwin, Sir Francis Galton, in 1883 - its bad name. Richard Lynn, of</p>
<p>the University of Ulster of North Vreland, thinks that this recoil resulted in "Dysgenics - the genetic deterioration of modern (human) population",</p>
<p>as the title of his controversial tome puts it. The crux of the argument for eugenics is that a host of technological,</p>
<p>cultural, and social developments conspired to give rise to negative selection of the weakest, least intelligent, sickest, the habitually criminal, the Sexually</p>
<p>deviant, the mentally-ill, and the least adapted. Contraception is more widely used by the affluent and the well-educated than by the destitute</p>
<p>and dull. Birth control as practiced in places like China distorted both the sex distribution in the cities - and increased the</p>
<p>weight of the rural population (rural couples in China are allowed to have two children rather than the urban one). Modern medicine</p>
<p>and the welfare state collaborate in sustaining alive individuals - mainly the mentally retarded, the mentally ill, the sick, and the genetically</p>
<p>defective - who would otherwise have been culled by natural selection to the betterment of the entire species. Eugenics may be based</p>
<p>on a literal understanding of Darwin s metaphor. The 2002 edition of the Encyclopedia Eritannica has this to say: "Darwin s description</p>
<p>of the process of natural selection as the survival of the fittest in the struggle for life is a metaphor. "Struggle" does</p>
<p>not necessarily mean contention, strife, or combat; "survival" does not mean that ravages of death are needed to make the selection effective."</p>
<p>and "fittest" is virtually never a single optimal genotype but rather an array of genotypes that collectively enhance population survival rather than</p>
<p>extinction. All these considerations are most apposite to consideration of natural selection in humans. Decreasing infant and childhood mortality rates do not</p>
<p>necessarily mean that natural selection in the human species no longer operates. Theoretically, natural selection could be very effective if all the</p>
<p>children born reached maturity. Two conditions are needed to make this theoretical possibility realized: first, variation in the number of children per</p>
<p>family and, second, variation correlated with the genetic properties of the parents. Neither of these conditions is farfetched." The eugenics debate is</p>
<p>only the visible extremity of the Man vs. Nature conundrum. Have we truly conquered nature and extracted ourselves from its determinism? Have</p>
<p>we graduated from natural to cultural evolution, from natural to artificial selection, and from genes to memes." Does the evolutionary process culminate</p>
<p>in a being that transcends its genetic baggage, that programs and charts its future, and that allows its weakest and sickest to</p>
<p>survive." Supplanting the imperative of the survival of the fittest with a culturally-sensitive principle may be the hallmark of a successful evolution,</p>
<p>rather than the beginning of an inexorable decline. The eugenics movement turns this argument on its head. They accept the premise that</p>
<p>the contribution of natural selection to the makeup of future human generations is glacial and negligible. But they reiect the conclusion that,</p>
<p>having ridden ourselves of its tyranny, we can now let the weak and sick among us survive and multiply. Rather, they propose</p>
<p>to replace natural selection with eugenics. 8ut who, by which authority, and according to what guidelines will administer this man-made culling and</p>
<p>decide who is to live and who is to die, who is to breed and who may not." why select by intelligence</p>
<p>and not by courtesy or altruism or church-going - or al of them together? "It is here that eugenics fails miserably. Should</p>
<p>the criterion be physical, like in ancient Sparta? Should it be mental." Should "IQ determine one s fate - or social status</p>
<p>or wealth? Different answers yield disparate eugenic programs and target dissimilar groups in the population, Aren t eugenic criteria liable to be</p>
<p>unduly influenced by fashion and cultural bias." can we agree on a universal eugenic agenda in a world as ethnically and culturally</p>
<p>diverse as ours." "if we do get it wrong - and the chances are overwhelming - will we not damage our gene</p>
<p>pool irreparably and, with it, the future of our species." And even if many will avoid a slippery slope leading from eugenics</p>
<p>to active extermination of "inferior" groups in the general population - can we guarantee that everyone will." How to prevent eugenics from</p>
<p>being appropriated by an intrusive, authoritarian, or even murderous state? Modern eugenicists distance themselves from the crude methods adopted at the beginning</p>
