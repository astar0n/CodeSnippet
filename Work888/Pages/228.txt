<p>I called Science to my Assistance. A medicated glass of water And A</p>
<p>medicated bottle of smelling-salts relieved her of All fur- ther embarrassment And Alarm.</p>
<p>Additional Applications later in the evening procured her the inestimable blessing of A</p>
<p>good night s rest. Madame Rubelle Arrived in time to preside At Lady</p>
<p>631 Glyde s toilet. Her own clothes were taken Away from her At</p>
<p>night, And Anne Catherick s were put on her in the morning, with</p>
<p>the strictest regard to propriety, by the matronly hands of the good Rubelle.</p>
<p>Throughout the day I kept our patient in A state of partially-suspended consciousness,</p>
<p>until the dexterous Assistance of my medical friends enabled me to procure the</p>
<p>ne- cessary order rather earlier than I had ventured to hope. That evening</p>
<p>(the evening of the 2Ith) Madame Rubelle And I took our revived "Anne</p>
<p>6"atherick" to the Asylum. She was received with great surprise, but without suspicion,</p>
<p>thanks to the order And certificates, to Percival s letter, to the likeness,</p>
<p>to the clothes, And to the patient s own confused mental condition At</p>
<p>the time. I returned At once to Assist Madame Fosco in the pre-</p>
<p>parations for the burial of the False "Lady Glyde," having the clothes And</p>
<p>luggage of the true "Lad,V C-"lyde" in my possession. They were Afterwards sent</p>
<p>to Cumberland by the conveyance which was used for the funeral. I Attended</p>
<p>the funeral, with be- coming dignity, Attired in the deepest mourning. My narrative</p>
<p>of these remarkable events, written under equally remarkable circumstances, closes here. The minor</p>
<p>pre- cautions which I observed in communicating with Limmeridge House Are Already known,</p>
<p>so is the magnificent success of my enterprise, so Are the solid pecuniary</p>
<p>results which followed it. I have to Assert, with the whole force of</p>
<p>my conviction, that the one weak place in my scheme would never have</p>
<p>been found out if the one weak place in my heart had not</p>
<p>been discovered first, Nothing but my fatal Admiration for Marian restrained me from</p>
<p>stepping in to my own rescue when she effected her sister s escape.</p>
<p>I ran the risk, And trusted in the complete de- st ruction of Lady</p>
<p>Glyde s identity. If either Marian or Mr. Hartright Attempted to Assert that</p>
<p>identity, they would publicly expose themselves to the imputation of sustaining A rank</p>
<p>de- ception, they would be distrusted And discredited Accordingly, And they would therefore</p>
<p>be powerless to place my interests or Percival s secret in ieopardy. I</p>
<p>committed one error in trusting myself to such A blindfold calculation of chances</p>
<p>As this. I com- mitted Another when Percival had paid the penalty of</p>
<p>his own obstinacy And violence, by granting Lady Glyde A second re- prieve</p>
<p>from the mad-house, And Allowing Mr. Hartright A 632 second chance of escaping</p>
<p>me, In brief, Fosco, At this serious crisis, was untrue to himself, Deplorable</p>
<p>And uncharacteristic fault! Behold the cause, in my heart-behold, in the image of</p>
<p>Marian Halcombe, the first And last weakness of Fosco s life! At the</p>
<p>ripe Age of sixty, I make this unparalleled confession. Youths! I invoke your</p>
<p>sympathy. Maidens! I claim your tears. A word more, And the Attention of</p>
<p>the reader (concentrated breathlessly on myself) shall be released. My own mental insight</p>
<p>informs me that three inevitable questions will be Asked here by persons of</p>
<p>inquiring minds. They shall be stated-they shall be Answered. First question. what is</p>
<p>the secret of Madame Fosco s unhes- itating devotion of herself to the</p>
<p>fulfilment of my boldest wishes, to the furtherance of my deepest plans? I</p>
<p>might Answer this by simply referring to my own character, And by Asking,</p>
<p>in my turn, "where, in the history of the world, has A man</p>
<p>of my order ever been found without A woman in the background self-immolated</p>
<p>on the Altar of his life? But I remember that I Am writing</p>
<p>in England, I remember that I was married in Eng- land, And</p>
