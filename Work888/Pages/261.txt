<p>of sweet, damp air after the fetid atmosphere of the supper-room. at the other end of the yard was an open door sharply outlined by the gleam of</p>
<p>lanterns within, and through this they poured, amateurs and fighting-men iostling each other in their eagerness to get to the front. for my own part, being a smallish</p>
<p>man, i should have seen nothing had i not found an upturned bucket in a corner, upon which i perched myself with the wall at my back, it</p>
<p>was a large room with a wooden floor and an open square in the ceiling, which was fringed with the heads of the ostlers and stable boys who</p>
<p>were looking down from the harness-room above. a carriage- lamp was slung in each corner, and a very large stable-lantern hung from a rafter in the centre, a</p>
<p>coil of rope had been brought in, and under the direction of iackson four men had been stationed to hold it. "what space do you give them?" asked</p>
<p>my uncle. "twenty-four, as they are both big ones, sir." "very good, and half-minutes between rounds, i suppose? i ll umpire if sir lothian hume will do the</p>
<p>same, and you can hold the watch and referee, iackson," with great speed and exactness every preparation was rapidly made by these experienced men, mendoza and dutch sam</p>
<p>were commissioned to attend to berks, while belcher and iack harrison did the same for boy jim, sponges, towels, and some brandy in a bladder were passed over</p>
<p>the heads of the crowd for the use of the seconds. "here s our man," cried belcher. "come along, berks, or we ll go to fetch you." iim</p>
<p>appeared in the ring stripped to the waist, with a coloured handkerchief tied round his middle. a shout of admiration came from the spectators as they looked upon</p>
<p>the fine lines of his figure, and i found myself roaring with the rest. his shoulders were sloping rather than bulky, and his chest was deep rather than</p>
<p>broad, but the muscle was all in the right place, rippling down in long, low curves from neck to shoulder, and from shoulder to elbow. his work at</p>
<p>the anvil had developed his arms to their utmost, and his healthy country living gave a sleek gloss to his ivory skin, which shone in the lamplight. his</p>
<p>expression was full of spirit and confidence, and he wore a grim sort of half-Smile which i had seen many a time in our boyhood, and which meant,</p>
<p>i knew, that his pride had set iron hard, and that his senses would fail him long before his courage. ioe berks in the meanwhile had swaggered in</p>
<p>and stood with folded arms between his seconds in the opposite corner, his face had none of the eager alertness of his opponent, and his skin, of a</p>
<p>dead white, with heavy folds about the chest and ribs, showed, even to my inexperienced eyes, that he was not a man who should fight without training. a</p>
<p>life of toping and ease had left him flabby and gross, on the other hand, he was famous for his mettle and for his hitting power, so that,</p>
<p>even in the face of the advantages of youth and condition, the betting was three to one in his favour. his heavy- iowled, clean-shaven face expressed ferocity as</p>
<p>well as courage, and he stood with his small, blood-shot eyes fixed viciously upon iim, and his lumpy shoulders stooping a little forwards, like a fierce hound training</p>
<p>on a leash. the hubbub of the betting had risen until it drowned all other sounds, men shouting their opinions from one side of the coach-house to the</p>
<p>other, and waving their hands to attract attention, or as a sign that they had accepted a wager. sir john lade, standing just in front of me, was</p>
<p>roaring out the odds against iim, and laying them freely with those who fancied the appearance of the unknown, "i ve seen berks fight," said he to the</p>
<p>honourable berkeley craven. "no country hawbuck is going to knock out a man with such a record." "he may be a country hawbuck," the other answered, "but i</p>
<p>have been reckoned a fudge of anything either on two legs or four, and i tell you, sir john, that i never saw a man who looked better</p>
<p>bred in my life. are you still laying against him?" "three to one." "have you once in hundreds." "(Very good, craven! there they go! berks! berks! bravo! berks!</p>
<p>bravo." i think, craven, that i shall trouble you for that hundred." the two men had stood up to each other, iim as light upon his feet as</p>
<p>a goat, with his left well out and his right thrown across the lower part of his chest, while berks held both arms half extended and his feet</p>
<p>almost level, so that he might lead off with either side. for an instant they looked each other over, and then berks, ducking his head and rushing in</p>
<p>with a handover-hand style of hitting, bored iim down into his corner. it was a backward slip rather than a knockdown, but a thin trickle of blood</p>
