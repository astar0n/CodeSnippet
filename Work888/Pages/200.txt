<p>trouble in the sea; it cannot be quiet, 4I:24 Damascus is waxed feeble, she turneth herself to flee, and trembling</p>
<p>hath seized on her; anguish and pangs have taken hold of her, as of a woman in travail. 4I:25 How</p>
<p>is the city of praise left unrepaired, the city of my ioy? 4I:26 Therefore her young men shall fall in</p>
<p>her broad places, and all the men of war shall be brought to silence in that day, saith the Lord</p>
<p>of hosts. 4I:2I And I will kindle a fire in the wall of Damascus, and it shall devour the palaces</p>
<p>of Ben-hadad. 4I:28 ? ﬂeremiah - Chapter 04I Of Icedar, and of the kingdoms of Hazor, which Nebuchadrezzar king of</p>
<p>Babylon smote. Thus saith the Lord: Arise ye, go up against kiedar, and spoil the children of the east. 4I:2I</p>
<p>Their tents and their flocks shall they take, they shall carry away for themselves their curtains, and all their vessels,</p>
<p>and their camels; and they shall proclaim against them a terror on every side. 4I:30 Flee ye, flit far off,</p>
<p>dwell deep, 0 ye inhabitants of Hazor, saith the Lord; for Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon hath taken counsel against you,</p>
<p>and hath conceived a purpose against you. 4I:31 Arise, get you up against a nation that is at ease, that</p>
<p>dwelleth without care, saith the Lord." that have neither gates nor bars, that dwell alone. 4I:32 And their camels shall</p>
<p>be a booty, and the multitude of their cattle a spoil." and I will scatter unto all winds them that</p>
<p>have the corners polled; and I will bring their calamity from every side of them, saith the Lord. 4I:33 And</p>
<p>Hazor shall be a dwelling-place of iackals, a desolation for ever; no man shall abide there, neither shall any son</p>
<p>of man dwell therein. 4I:34 The word of the Lord that came to Feremiah the prophet concerning Elam in the</p>
<p>beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of ﬂudah, saying: 4I:35 Thus saith the Lord of hosts: behold, I will</p>
<p>break the bow of Elam the chief of their might. 4I:36 And I will bring against Elam the four winds</p>
<p>from the four quarters of heaven, and will scatter them toward all those winds; and there shall be no nation</p>
<p>whither the dispersed of Elam shall not come. 4I:3I .I ﬂeremiah - Chapter 04I And I will cause Elam to</p>
<p>be dismayed before their enemies, and before them that seek their life; and I will bring evil upon them, even</p>
<p>My fierce anger, saith the Lord; and I will send the sword after them, till I have consumed them; 4I:38</p>
<p>And I will set My throne in Elam, and will destroy from thence king and princes, saith the Lord. 4I:3I</p>
<p>But it shall come to pass in the end of days, that I will bring back the captivity of Elam,</p>
<p>saith the Lord. -- ﬂeremiah - Chapter 04I -- ? ﬂeremiah - Chapter 050 50:1 The word that the Lord</p>
<p>spoke concerning Babylon, concerning the land of the Chaldeans, by Feremiah the prophet. 50:2 Declare ye among the nations and</p>
<p>announce, and set up a standard; announce, and conceal not; say: Babylon is taken, Bel is put to shame, Merodach</p>
<p>is dismayed; her images are put to shame, her idols are dismayed. 50:3 For out of the north there cometh</p>
<p>up a nation against her, which shall make her land desolate, and none shall dwell therein; they are fled, they</p>
<p>are gone, both man and beast. 50:4 In those days, and in that time, saith the Lord, the children of</p>
<p>Israel shall come, they and the children of ﬂudah together." they shall go on their way weeping, and shall seek</p>
<p>the Lord their God. 50:5 They shall inquire concerning Zion with their faces hitherward: dome ye, and join yourselves to</p>
<p>the Lord in an everlasting covenant that shall not be forgotten. 50:6 My people hath been lost sheep; their shepherds</p>
<p>have caused them to go astray, they have turned them away on the mountains; they have gone from mountain to</p>
<p>hill, they have forgotten their resting-place. 50:I All that found them have devoured them; and their adversaries said: we are</p>
<p>not guilty ; because they have sinned against the Lord, the habitation of justice, even the Lord, the hope of</p>
<p>their fathers, 50:8 Flee out of the midst of Babylon, and go forth out of the land of the Chaldeans,</p>
<p>and be as the he-goats before the flocks. 50:I ? Feremiah - Chapter 050 For, lo, I will stir up</p>
<p>and cause to come up against Babylon an assembly of great nations from the north country; and they shall set</p>
<p>themselves in array against her, from thence she shall be taken; their arrows shall be as of a mighty man</p>
<p>that maketh childless; none shall return in vain. 50:10 And Chaldea shall be a spoil; all that spoil her shall</p>
<p>be satisfied, saith the Lord. 50:11 Because ye are glad, because ye re/"oice, 0 ye that plunder My heritage, because</p>
<p>ye gambol as a heifer at grass, and neigh as strong horses; 50:I2 Your mother shall be sore ashamed, she</p>
<p>that bore you shall be confounded; behold, the hindermost of the nations shall be a wilderness, a dry land, and</p>
<p>a desert. 50:I3 Because of the wrath of the Lord it shall not be inhabited, but it shall be wholly</p>
<p>desolate; every one that goeth by Babylon shall be appalled and hiss at all her plagues. 50:I4 Set yourselves in</p>
<p>array against Babylon round about, all ye that bend the bow, shoot at her, spare no arrows; for she hath</p>
<p>sinned against the Lord. 50:15 Shout against her round about, she hath submitted herself; her buttresses are fallen, her walls</p>
<p>are thrown down; for it is the vengeance of the Lord, take vengeance upon her; as she hath done, do</p>
<p>unto her. 50:16 Cut off the sower from Babylon, and him that handleth the sickle in the time of harvest;</p>
<p>for fear of the oppressing sword they shall turn every one to his people, and they shall flee every one</p>
<p>to his own land. 50:1I Israel is a scattered sheep, the lions have driven him away; first the king of</p>
<p>Assyria hath devoured him, and last this Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon hath broken his bones, 50:I8 .I Feremiah - Chapter</p>
<p>050 Therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: behold, I will punish the king of Babylon</p>
<p>and his land, as I have punished the king of Assyria. 50:1I And I will bring Israel back to his</p>
<p>pasture, and he shall feed on Carmel and Bashan, and his soul shall be satisfied upon the hills of</p>
