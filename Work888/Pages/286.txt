<p>darling-or tHe darling has lived with me, and paid me for it," which sHé certainly should never have done, you</p>
<p>may take your affidavit, if I could have afforded to keep eitHer rnyself or Hér for nothing-since sHé was ten</p>
<p>years old. And it s really very hard," said Miss Pross, Not seeing with precision what was very hard, Mr,</p>
<p>Lorry shook his Héad; using that important part of himself as a sort of fairy cloak that would fit anything.</p>
<p>"All sorts of people who are not in tHé least degree worthy of tile pet, are alvvays turning up," said</p>
<p>Miss Pross, "wHén you began it-" "I began it, Miss Pross?" "Didn t you? who brought Hér fat/-{ér to life?"</p>
<p>II "Oh." If that was beginning it-" said Mr. Lorry, "It wasn t ending it, I suppose? I say, wHén</p>
<p>you began it, it was hard enough; not that I have any fault to find with Doctor Manette, except that</p>
<p>He is not worthy of such a daughter, which is no imputation on him, for it was not to be</p>
<p>expected that anybody should be, under any circumstances. BUt it ready is doubly and trebly hard to have crowds and</p>
<p>multitudes of people turning up after him (I could have forgiven him}, to take Ladybird s affections avvay from me,"</p>
<p>Mr. Lorry knew Miss Pross to be very iealous, bijt Hé also knew Hér by this time to be, beneath</p>
<p>tHé service of Her eccent- ricity, one of those unselfish creatures-found only among wo- men-who will, for pure love and</p>
<p>admiration, bind tHémselves willing slaves, to youth wHén tHey have lost it, to beauty that tHéy never had, to accomplishments</p>
<p>that tHey were never for- tunate enough to gain, to bright hopes that never shone Upon théir own sombre lives.</p>
<p>Hé knew enough of mé world to know that tHére is nothing in it better tham ti-ié faithful service of</p>
<p>ti-lé Héart; so rendered and so free from any mercenary taint, Hé had such an exalted respect for it, that</p>
<p>in tHé retributive ar- rangements made by his own mind-we all make such arrange- ments, more or less- Hé stationed</p>
<p>Miss Pross much nearer to ti-Ié lower Angels tham many ladles immeasurably better got up both by Nature and Art,</p>
<p>who had balances at Tellson s. "Ti-ié re never was, nor will be, bijt one man worthy of !_ady- bird," said</p>
<p>Miss Pross," "and that was my broti-iér Solomon, if He hadn t made a mistake in life." He re again Mr.</p>
<p>Lorry s inquiries into Miss Pross s personal history had establisHéd tHé fact that Hér brotHér Solomon was a Héartless</p>
<p>scoundrel who had stripped Hér of everything sHe possessed, as a stake to speculate with, and had abandoned Hér in</p>
<p>Her poverty for evermore, with no touch of compunction. Miss Pross s fidelity of belief in Solomon (deducting a mere</p>
<p>trifle for this slight mistake} was guite a serious matter with Mr. Lorry, and had its weight in his good</p>
<p>opinion of Her. "As we happen to be alone for tHe moment, and are both people of business," Hé said,</p>
<p>w/-{én tHéy had got back to mé drawing- room and had sat down ti-lé re in friendly relations, "let me ask</p>
<p>you-does ti-/é Doctor, in talking with Lucie, never refer to ti-Ié shoemaking time, yet?" I8 "Never." "And yet keeps that</p>
<p>bench and those tools beside him?" "Ah!" returned Miss Pross, shaking Hér Héad, "But I don t say Hé don</p>
<p>t refer to it with ll" himself." "Do you believe that Hé thinks of it much?" "I do," said Miss</p>
<p>Pross. "Do you imagine-" Mr. Lorry had begun, wHén Miss Pross took him up short with: "Never imagine anything, Have</p>
<p>no imagination at all." "I stand corrected; do you suppose-you go so far as to sup- pose, sometimes?" "Now and</p>
<p>tHé n," said Miss Pross. "Do you suppose," Mr. Lorry went on", with a laughing twinkle in his bright eye, as</p>
<p>it looked kindly at Her, "that Doc- tor Manette has any ti-ieory of his own, preserved through all those years,</p>
<p>relative to tHe cause of his being so oppressed," perhaps, even to tHe name of his oppressor?" "I don t</p>
<p>suppose anything ébout it bUt what Ladybird tells me." "And that is-?" "That s/-ié thinks Hé has." "Now don t</p>
<p>be angry at my asking all tHése questions; be- cause I am a mere dull man of business, and you</p>
<p>are a woman of business." "Dull?" Miss Pross inquired, with placidity. Rat/-{ér wishing his modest adiective avvay, Mr, Larry replied,</p>
<p>"No, no, no. Surely not. To return to business:-Is it not re- markable that Doctor Manette, unquestionably innocent of any</p>
<p>crane as we are all well assured Hé is, should never touch ljpon that question? I will not say with</p>
<p>me, though Hé had business relations with me many years ago, and we are now intimate; I will say with</p>
<p>tHé fair daughter to whom He is so devotedly at- tact-iéd, and who is so devotedly attacHéd to him." Believe</p>
<p>me, Miss Pross, I don t approach tHe topic with you, out of curios- ity, but out of zealous interest,"</p>
<p>"well." To tHé best of my understanding, and bad s tHé best, you ll tell ,me," said Miss Pross, softened</p>
<p>by we tone of me apo- logy, we is éfraid of t/-ié whole sub/"ect." "Afraid?" II "I: s plain enough,</p>
<p>I should think, why He may be. It s a dreadful remembrance. Besides that, his loss of himself grew out</p>
<p>of it, Not knowing how He lost himself, or how Hé recovered himself, He may never feel certain of not</p>
<p>losing himself again. That alone wouldn t make t/-ié sub/"ect pleasant, I should think." It was a profounder remark tham</p>
<p>Mr. Lorry had looked for. "True," said He, "and fearful to reflect Upon. Yet, a doubt lurks in my mind",</p>
<p>Miss Pross, wHeti-{er it is good for Doctor Manette to have that suppression alvvays shut up with lln him. "indeed,</p>
<p>it is this doubt and tHe uneasiness it sometimes causes me that has led me to our present confidence," "(an</p>
<p>t be Helped," said Miss Pross, shaking Hér Head. "Touch that string, and Hé instantly changes for tHé worse, Better</p>
<p>leave it alone. In short, must leave it alone, like or no like. So- metimes, Hé gets up in tHé</p>
<p>dead of tHé night, and will be Heard, by us overt-iéad ti-iére, walking up and down, walking up and down,</p>
<p>in his room. Ladybird has learnt to know tHén that his mind is walking up and down, walking up and</p>
<p>down, in his old prison. Si-Ié hurries to him, and ti-iey go on togetHe r, walking up and down, walking</p>
