<p>humans where to find us." "then where are we going?" "by nightfall we should reach an outpost. we can stay</p>
<p>there until tomorrow." "and then where?" sara asked. "the netherworld?" "no. we have to go to vesuvia and see the</p>
<p>council. they need to know what s going on, and they re likely upset that i haven t returned yet."</p>
<p>"vesuvia? we re actually going to vesuvia? that s your capital, isn t it?" "kind of, it s the only</p>
<p>city we have." "just one city? it must be huge to hold all of your people." "yeah, compared to what</p>
<p>humans have here in rhea. but i guess it s not really fair since we ve been here for ages</p>
<p>and you humans made your first settlement...what was it, a little over a hundred years ago?" "i m not exactly</p>
<p>sure," sara answered. "a hundred and fifty years, i think." "no way," leon said. "it can t be older than</p>
<p>me. i remember seeing the first human settlers." "what?! you don t look a day past twentyfive." "i m a</p>
<p>hundred and fortythree." leon said. "and you?" "i just turned twentyone a few weeks ago," sara said. "do all vesuvians</p>
<p>age that slowly?" "pretty much," leon said, breaking several small branches in his path. there was a brief moment of</p>
<p>silence as sara continued to follow. "how old do vesuvians "good question. no one really knows." "you re telling me</p>
<p>no vesuvian has ever died of old age? how is that?" "well, the oldest one is maybe two thousand years</p>
<p>old." "?o every vesuvian that came before him died of unnatural causes?" "yup," leon answered. "and please don t ask</p>
<p>me to explain all the different ways a vesuvian can die. but i can tell you the eldest vesuvian to</p>
<p>ever live, an orlok, died shortly before humans first stepped foot on rhea." "what s an orlok?" sara asked. "one</p>
<p>of the vesuvian houses, and now that i remember, an orlok can be younger than me and still look ugly</p>
<p>as sin. they start out fine, but they go downhill fast." sara laughed. "that bad, huh? how many houses are</p>
<p>there?" "seven." "that s it? which one do you belong?" at that moment leon stopped in front of a narrow,</p>
<p>fivefoot deep ditch with a small stream running through it. he hopped down and extended a helping hand to sara.</p>
<p>ignoring the offer, sara hopped down as well. leon shrugged and skipped over the narrow stream before making a scarcely</p>
<p>believable eight foot leap up to the other side of the ditch. it wasn t until sara crossed the stream</p>
<p>that she realized the difficulty of the obstacle in front of her. leon knelt down and again extended his hand.</p>
<p>this time sara accepted, and with a quick pull by leon, she was up on the other side of the</p>
<p>ditch. as leon turned to move on, sara gripped his hand tight and pulled. "which house?" she asked. leon gently</p>
<p>pulled away. "all of them," he said. after several hours of travel, sara and leon came to a small clearing</p>
<p>and stopped. sara was becoming exhausted. stretching her legs, she could see several small buildings across the clearing, and noticed</p>
<p>dusk was fast approaching. "there s the outpost," leon said, still looking as fresh as when they journey started. "you</p>
<p>can rest up there." "leon, you re not tired?" sara asked. "not really," leon answered, walking toward the outpost with</p>
<p>sara close behind. "i hope your beds are comfy." "just let me do the talking." when they reached the outpost,</p>
<p>leon knocked on the door. a small peephole slid open and a male voice with an accent spoke. "what you</p>
<p>s doing here?!" "i m escorting this human to see the council," leon said. "what s the matter? ya lost?"</p>
<p>"the human needs rest." the peephole slammed shut and the door opened. standing before leon was a grungylooking man of</p>
<p>similar height, with braided hair down to the shoulders. sara could see both of his arms were covered with tattoos.</p>
<p>"come in," he said, stepping aside. leon entered and quickly looked around. "you alone?" "yeah," the vesuvian guard said, and</p>
<p>then sitting at a table with cards laid out. sara entered, making sure to stick close to leon as she</p>
<p>examined the dimly lit room. leon pointed. "the bed is right over there." "thanks," sara said, then walking over and</p>
<p>sat at the edge of the bed. leon sat across from the guard, who was busy playing with the cards.</p>
<p>"what s the council want with a human?" the guard asked. "not much," leon said. "with everything that s going</p>
<p>on, they want to see if they can help." the guard laughed. "help? them?" sara ignored the insult. "i take</p>
<p>it you haven t met many humans," leon said, watching the llvard play. "they re full of surprises." "i 1I3</p>
<p>sure," the guard said. sara sat, rubbing her legs, though never taking her eyes off the vesuvians. "how far have</p>
<p>you gotten?" leon asked of the game. "i ve never been able to win." the guard stifled a laugh. "everyone</p>
<p>knows that. you still got the fastest record for using all your moves at nella s pub." sara noticed leon</p>
<p>shift as if he wasn t too comfortable, and that made her uncomfortable. "tell you what," leon said to the</p>
<p>guard. "why don t you take the night off? i ll cover for the guard looked at leon for a</p>
<p>moment. "you got no bloody argument here." he stood up and walked out. leon walked to the door and locked</p>
<p>it. "he wasn t too friendly," sara said. leon shrugged and lay on a bed across the room. sara lay</p>
<p>down al?o. "i thought you weren t tired," she said. "sleep saves energy," leon responded. sara yawned. "good night, leon."</p>
<p>"good night," leon said before dozing off for several hours. at ?ome point in the middle of the night, leon</p>
<p>began to constantly shift in bed, making small grunting noises. before long, he woke sitting upright, sweating and out</p>
