<p>became one of the first Buddhist nuns. Iust at this time however she remained in her house but Rahula, Gautam</p>
<p>s son, was converted. Gautam s father was aggrieved at this and asked Gautama to establish a rule that no</p>
<p>one should in future be admitted to the order without his parents consent. Gautama consented to this and made a</p>
<p>rule accordingly. On his way back to Raigrha, Gautama stopped for some time at Anupiya, a town belonging to the</p>
<p>Mallas. And while he was stopping there he made many converts both from the kcolian and from the Shakya tribe,</p>
<p>some of whom deserve special mention. Aniruddh, the Shakya, went to his mother and asked to be allowed to go</p>
<p>into the houseless state. His mother did not know how to stop him and so told him, "If Bhaddiya, the</p>
<p>Shakya, will renounce the world thou also mayest go forth into the houseless state." Aniruddha accordingly went to Bhaddiya and</p>
<p>it was decided that they should embrace the order in seven days. chulvagga, the Buddhist Sutra says: So Bhaddiya, the</p>
<p>Shakyara/", and Aniruddha, and Ananda and Bhagu and Kimball and Der/adatt /"ust as they had so often previously gone out</p>
<p>to the pleasure ground with fourfold array, and Upali the barber went with them, making seven in all. And when</p>
<p>they had gone some distance, they sent their retinue back and crossed over to the neighboring district and took off</p>
<p>their fine things and wrapped them in their robe and made a bundle of them and said to Upali the</p>
<p>barber; " Do you now, Upali, turn back. These things will be sufficient for you to live upon," But Upali</p>
<p>was of a different mind so all the seven went to Gautama and became converts. And when Bhaddiya had retired</p>
<p>into solitude, he exclaimed over and over, " 0 happiness! 0 happiness!" And on being asked the cause said: "Formerly,</p>
<p>Lord when I was a king I" had a guard, completely provided, both within and without my private apartments, both</p>
<p>within and without and town and within the borders of my country. Yet though "I was thus guarded and protected</p>
<p>"I was fearful, anxious, distrustful and alarmed. But bow, Lord, even in the forest at the foot of a tree</p>
<p>in solitude I am without fear or anxiety, trustful and not alarmed," I dwell at ease, subdued, secure, with mind</p>
<p>as peaceful as an antelope." Of these converts Ananda became the most intimate friend and companion of Gautama and after</p>
<p>his death led the band of 500 monks in chanting the Dharma in the council of Ra/"agrha, Upali, though barber</p>
<p>by birth, became an eminent member of the order and his name is often mentioned in connection with the Vinyapitak,</p>
<p>Devadatta became subsequently the rival and opponent of Gautama and is even said to have advised Aiatashatru, the prince of</p>
<p>Magadha, to kill his father Bimbisara and then attempted to kill Gautama himself. After spending his second Vas or rain)"</p>
<p>season in Raiagrha Gautama repaired to Sravasti, the capital of kiosalas, where Prasenaiit reigned as king. A wood called iaitvan</p>
<p>was presented to the Buddhists and Gautama often repaired and preached there. Gautam s instructions were always delivered orally and</p>
<p>preserved in the memory of the people like all the ancient books of India, although writing was known at this</p>
<p>time. The third Vas was also passed in Raiagrha and in the fourth year from the date of proclaiming is</p>
<p>creed Gautama crossed the Ganges, went to Vaisali and stopped in the Mahavana grove. Thence he is said to have</p>
<p>made a miraculous iourney through the air to settle a dispute between the Shakyas and iéolians about the water of</p>
<p>the Boundary River Rohini. "in the following year he again repaired to /éapilvastu and was present at the death of</p>
<p>his father, then .II years old. His widowed step mother Praiapati Gautami and his no less widowed wife Yashodhara had</p>
<p>now no ties to bind then to the world and insisted on ioining the order established by Gautama. The sage</p>
<p>had not yet admitted women to the order and was naturally most reluctant to do so. But his mother was</p>
<p>inexorable and followed him to Vaisali and begged to be admitted. Ananda pleaded her case but Gautama still replied: "</p>
<p>Enough, Ananda, Let it not please thee that women should be allowed to do so." But Ananda persisted and asked,</p>
<p>"Are women, Lord, capable when they have gone forth form the household life and entered the homeless state under the</p>
<p>doctrine and discipline proclaimed by the blessed one, are they capable of realizing the fruit of conversion, or of the</p>
<p>second path or of Arhat ship?".? There could be only one reply to this Honor to women has ever been</p>
<p>a part of religion in "India and salvation and heaven are not barred to the female sex by the Hindu</p>
<p>religion. "They are capable," reluctantly replied Gautama. And Praiapati and other ladies were admitted to the order as Bhikkhunee under</p>
<p>some rules making them strictly subordinate to Bhikkhu. After this Gautama retired to kﬁausambi near Prayag {Allahabad}. "In the sixth</p>
<p>year after spending the rains at kzausambi Gautama returned to Raiagrha, and /<shema the queen of Bimbisara was admitted to</p>
<p>the order. "in same year Gautama is said to have performed miracles at Sravasti and went to heaven to teach</p>
<p>Dharma to his mother who had died I days after his birth. In the eleventh year Gautama converted the Brahmin</p>
<p>Bharadvaia. "in the next year he undertook the longest iourney he had ever made and then preached the famous Mharahulsutan</p>
<p>to his son Rahula, then 18 years old. Two years later Rahula was admitted in the order. In the fifteenth</p>
<p>year he visited téapilat/astu again and addressed a discourse to his cousin Mahanama, who had succeeded Bhaddiya, the successor of</p>
<p>Shuddhodana. Gautam s father in law Suprabuddha, the king of /<oli, publicly abused Gautama for deserting Yashodhara but is said</p>
<p>to have been swallowed up by the earth shortly after. "in the seventeenth year he delivered discourse on the death</p>
<p>of Shrimati, a courtesan; in the next year he converted a weaver who had accidentally killed his daughter; in the</p>
<p>following year he released a deer caught in a snare and converted the angry hunter who had wanted to shoot</p>
<p>him." and in the twentieth year he similarly converted the famous robber Angulimala of the Chaliya forest. For twenty five</p>
<p>years more Gautama wandered through the Gangetic valley, preached piety and holy life to the poor, the lowly and misguided,</p>
<p>made converts among the high and the low, the rich and the poor and proclaimed his law wherever he</p>
