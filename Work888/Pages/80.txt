<p>temple called ryoan-ii. not long after katsumoto s death, his villa and other estate buildings were set on fire during</p>
<p>the onin war and joined the general ruin of much of the rest of kyoto. in the last decade of</p>
<p>the fifteenth century the burned-out estate was restored by katsumoto s son, but in replacing the buildings he chose a</p>
<p>new style of zen architecture known as shoin, which included a special bay window and desk modeled after those in</p>
<p>chinese ch an monasteries. the shoin style had been recently popularized in kyoto by yoshimasa, who chose the design for</p>
<p>several buildings surrounding his silver pavilion. the shoin window overlooked the lake-and-island garden, but since the later zen monks who</p>
<p>controlled the estate had no interest in decorative landscape art, they walled off a small courtyard in front of the</p>
<p>window and installed a flat kare sansui garden for contemplation, which soon eclipsed in interest the older lake-and-island landscape. shortly</p>
<p>thereafter the shoin building was in turn destroyed by fire, giving the monks an excuse to bring in a pavilion</p>
<p>with a long viewing veranda from the neighboring seigen-in temple. this veranda, which was positioned along the long axis of</p>
<p>the kare sansui garden, now permits group meditation, something not possible from the single window of the earlier shoin structure.</p>
<p>modern visitors to ryoan-ii still pass through the older landscape garden en route to the main temple pavilion. from this</p>
<p>vantage point only the outer wall of the sand-and-stone garden can be seen; there is no hint of what lies</p>
<p>inside. on the temple steps the fragrance of incense mingles with the natural perfume of the ancient trees which line</p>
<p>the pathways of the lake. as one enters the dimly lighted hallway of the temple, street shoes are replaced by</p>
<p>noiseless, cushioned slippers. shod in silence, visitors walk along the temple hallways onto the long ho/"o veranda facing the garden,</p>
<p>where the brilliance of the shimmering sand washes unexpectedly over the senses. the effect is sudden and striking. what one</p>
<p>sees, in purely prosaic terms, is an area of rippled sand about the size of a tennis court, set about</p>
<p>with fifteen not particularly unusual (by ashikaga standards) stones arrayed in five distinct clusters. the white sand is raked lengthwise</p>
<p>(a routine task for a lay brother), and concentric circles are traced around each of the stones, imparting an illusion</p>
<p>of ripples. in the garden proper there is not a tree, indeed not a blade of grass, to be seen;</p>
<p>the only suggestion of living matter is the bed of ancient moss in which each group of stones lies nestled.</p>
<p>on the three sides of the garden opposite the veranda stands the ancient courtyard wall, whose oil-stained earthen brown contrasts</p>
<p>splendidly with the pure white sand. above the wall, which is capped with black clay tile in chinese fashion, one</p>
<p>can see the tall trees of the landscape garden, obscuring what must once have been a grand view of old</p>
<p>kyoto to the south. each of the five clusters of stones seems balanced around its own center of gravity, and</p>
<p>the clusters, in turn, appear to be balanced with one another-with the two groups of stones on the left being</p>
<p>approximately equal in mass to the three groups on the right. as is the case in most ashikaga gardens, each</p>
<p>grouping is dominated by one obviously assertive member, against which the smaller, less authoritative stones strain for prominence, producing a</p>
<p>sense of tension. simultaneously, there is a feeling of strength about each of the groups, since each cluster is set</p>
<p>on an island of mossy soil, which acts as a base to unite the assemblages. aesthetic stability is also achieved</p>
<p>by the placement of the stones at sufficient depth (or apparent depth) within their nest of moss so that only</p>
<p>their tips seem to protrude above the floor of the garden. the stones are set in two groups of two</p>
<p>stones, two groups of three, and one group of five. each of these groupings displays one or another of the</p>
<p>various ashikaga garden conventions. both groups of two stones make explicit use of contrasting shapes between their members, a standard</p>
<p>zen device. one of the pairs is composed of a long, vertical rock set like an upturned blade in the</p>
<p>sand, with a companion that is hardly more than a negligible lump, a token foil. the other pair has one</p>
<p>sharp-sided vertical stone with a flat plateau as a top, accompanied by a larger round rock which spreads at the</p>
<p>base. as has been noted, the ashikaga gardeners prized flat-topped stones highly because of their resemblance to the angular brushstrokes</p>
<p>of certain zen ink painters. life, in this case, was made to imitate art, or rather sculptural art was made</p>
<p>to imitate the pictorial. both pairs of stones are situated slightly off the lengthwise axis of the garden, maintaining the</p>
<p>asymmetry considered so essential. in the two groups of three stones, the intent is to establish the visual pre-eminence of</p>
<p>the largest member and to flank it with two comparatively insignificant smaller stones-usually differentiated in shape and attitude-thereby forming a</p>
<p>vertical triangle with the peak of the largest stone representing the apex. this particular arrangement was so common in ashikaga</p>
<p>gardens that it became known as the "three-deity" stone setting, supposedly a pious reference to a buddhist legend but probably</p>
<p>merely a convenient tag for a standardized artistic device, the last grouping is five stones, since arrangements of four were</p>
<p>considered too symmetrical by zen gardeners. in this case, the group is dominated by one large central boulder with four</p>
<p>ancillary rocks spread about its base like the feet of a granite beast. such, in physical terms, is the arrangement</p>
<p>of the garden, and when so described it seems undeserving of all the acclaim. its subiective qualities tell a bit</p>
<p>more of the story, it seems clear that the inclination of the stones is intended to evoke a sense of</p>
<p>motion, for they have all been placed with their longer axis corresponding to that of the garden. this quality</p>
