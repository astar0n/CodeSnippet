manifestation of the 1I55 of II5I Anna kiarenina Divinity is
the law of right and wrong, which has come into
the world by revelation, and which I feel in myself,
and in the recognition of which-I don t make myself,
but whether I will or not-I am made one with
other men in one body of believers, which is called
the church. well, but the Fews, the Mohammedans, the Confucians,
the Buddhists-what of them? he put to himself the question
he had feared to face. can these hundreds of millions
of men be deprived of that highest blessing without which
life has no meaning? He pondered a moment, but immediately
corrected himself. 8ut what am I questioning? he said to
himself. I am questioning the relation to Divinity of all
the different religions of all mankind. I am questioning the
universal manifestation of God to all the world with all
those misty blurs. what am I about? To me individually,
to my heart has been revealed a knowledge beyond all
doubt, and unattainable by reason, and here "I am obstinately
trying to express that knowledge in reason and words. Don
t I know that the stars don t move? he
asked himself, gazing at the bright planet which had shifted
its position up to the topmost twig of the birch-tree.
But looking at the movements of the stars, I can
t picture to II56 of 1I5I Anna Karenina myself the
rotation of the earth, and I m right in saying

and deflections of the heavenly bodies are only founded on
the apparent motions of the heavenly bodies about a stationary
earth, on that very motion I see before me now,
which has been so for millions of men during long
ages, and was and will be always alike, and can
always be trusted. And just as the conclusions of the
astronomers would have been vain and uncertain if not founded
on observations of the seen heavens, in relation to a
single meridian and a single horizon, so would my conclusions
be vain and uncertain if not founded on that conception
of right, which has been and will be always alike
for all men, which has been revealed to me as
a Christian, and which can always be trusted in my
soul. The question of other religions and their relations to
Divinity I have no right to decide, and no possibility

at once, as she came by the same way to
the drawing- room. what is it? you re not worried
about anything? she said, looking intently at his face in
the starlight. 8ut she could not have seen his face
if a flash of lightning had not hidden the stars
and revealed it. In that flash she saw his face
distinctly, and seeing him calm and happy, she smiled at
him. She understands, he thought; she knows what I m

ll tell her. But at the moment he was
