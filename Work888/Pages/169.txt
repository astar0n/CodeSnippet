<p>manifestation of the 1I55 of II5I Anna kiarenina Divinity is</p>
<p>the law of right and wrong, which has come into</p>
<p>the world by revelation, and which I feel in myself,</p>
<p>and in the recognition of which-I don t make myself,</p>
<p>but whether I will or not-I am made one with</p>
<p>other men in one body of believers, which is called</p>
<p>the church. well, but the Fews, the Mohammedans, the Confucians,</p>
<p>the Buddhists-what of them? he put to himself the question</p>
<p>he had feared to face. can these hundreds of millions</p>
<p>of men be deprived of that highest blessing without which</p>
<p>life has no meaning? He pondered a moment, but immediately</p>
<p>corrected himself. 8ut what am I questioning? he said to</p>
<p>himself. I am questioning the relation to Divinity of all</p>
<p>the different religions of all mankind. I am questioning the</p>
<p>universal manifestation of God to all the world with all</p>
<p>those misty blurs. what am I about? To me individually,</p>
<p>to my heart has been revealed a knowledge beyond all</p>
<p>doubt, and unattainable by reason, and here "I am obstinately</p>
<p>trying to express that knowledge in reason and words. Don</p>
<p>t I know that the stars don t move? he</p>
<p>asked himself, gazing at the bright planet which had shifted</p>
<p>its position up to the topmost twig of the birch-tree.</p>
<p>But looking at the movements of the stars, I can</p>
<p>t picture to II56 of 1I5I Anna Karenina myself the</p>
<p>rotation of the earth, and I m right in saying</p>
<p>that the stars move. And could the astronomers have understood</p>
<p>and calculated anything, if they had taken into account all</p>
<p>the complicated and varied motions of the earth? All the</p>
<p>marvelous conclusions they have reached about the distances, weights, movements,</p>
<p>and deflections of the heavenly bodies are only founded on</p>
<p>the apparent motions of the heavenly bodies about a stationary</p>
<p>earth, on that very motion I see before me now,</p>
<p>which has been so for millions of men during long</p>
<p>ages, and was and will be always alike, and can</p>
<p>always be trusted. And just as the conclusions of the</p>
<p>astronomers would have been vain and uncertain if not founded</p>
<p>on observations of the seen heavens, in relation to a</p>
<p>single meridian and a single horizon, so would my conclusions</p>
<p>be vain and uncertain if not founded on that conception</p>
<p>of right, which has been and will be always alike</p>
<p>for all men, which has been revealed to me as</p>
<p>a Christian, and which can always be trusted in my</p>
<p>soul. The question of other religions and their relations to</p>
<p>Divinity I have no right to decide, and no possibility</p>
<p>of deciding, 1I5I of 1I5I Anna kzarenina Oh, you haven</p>
<p>t gone in then? he heard k:itty s voice all</p>
<p>at once, as she came by the same way to</p>
<p>the drawing- room. what is it? you re not worried</p>
<p>about anything? she said, looking intently at his face in</p>
<p>the starlight. 8ut she could not have seen his face</p>
<p>if a flash of lightning had not hidden the stars</p>
<p>and revealed it. In that flash she saw his face</p>
<p>distinctly, and seeing him calm and happy, she smiled at</p>
<p>him. She understands, he thought; she knows what I m</p>
<p>thinking about. Shall I tell her or not? Yes, I</p>
<p>ll tell her. But at the moment he was</p>
