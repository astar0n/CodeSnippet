<p>great deal about both life and death. let s now take a look at what god, our creator, says about</p>
<p>life and death in his inspired word, the bible. you may be both surprised and challenged as you discover the</p>
<p>truth about what happens after death.-" the wondrous gift of life to understand death, we need to first consider: what</p>
<p>is life? the world s greatest thinkers, including the greek philo?ophers plato, aristotle and ?ocrates, have struggled with this question.</p>
<p>scientists and theologians have dedicated lifetimes to trying to find the keys that unlock the mystery of human existence. but</p>
<p>only the one who created life in the first place can supply the answers we ?o desperately need. we must</p>
<p>look at the very beginning of life to understand it. religion, philo?ophy and science acknowledge that physical life had a</p>
<p>beginning. ?ome believe that life evolved over millennia. but the bible reveals a god who boldly claims that he is</p>
<p>the creator of all life and that he created human life for a tremendous purpose. through his word, god gives</p>
<p>us his answers to life s most important questions. why human beings differ from animals much of humanity is familiar</p>
<p>with the account in genesis, the first book of the bible. genesis simply means "beginning" or "origin." in genesis god</p>
<p>reveals the origin of the forms of life we find on planet earth. notice what god says about human life</p>
<p>in genesis 1:26: "let us make man in our image, according to our likeness; let them have dominion over the</p>
<p>fish of the sea, over the birds of the air, and over the cattle, over all the earth and over</p>
<p>every creeping thing that creeps on the earth" {emphasis added throughout). god intended that other forms of life be subject</p>
<p>to man as part of an extraordinary higher purpose for man. only mankind was created in god s very imagea</p>
<p>designation that applies to no other part of his creation. human beings are unique among god s physical creation in</p>
<p>their godlike abilities to make decisions, plan and create. far beyond providing us with animallike instinct, god created within us</p>
<p>intellect, selfawareness, the capacity to learn, rea?on, communicate and produce. human brains are physically quite similar to ?ome animal brains,</p>
<p>yet people have vastly higher abilities. the bible reveals that the difference between the human mind and the animal brain</p>
<p>is the spiritual essence god included in the makeup of human beings: "for what man knows the things of a</p>
<p>man except [by] the spirit of the man which is in him?" (1 corinthians 2:11; see al?o /"ob 32:8; zechariah</p>
<p>I2:1). ?omething is still missing in human beings paul refers to the "spirit of the man" as that which makes</p>
<p>people intellectually superior to animals. it separates us from other physical creatures, allowing us to know"the things of a man,"</p>
<p>to think and understand on a much higher plane. we were created to possess certain intellectual capacities similar to those</p>
<p>of the creator himself {genesis 1:26), enabling us to develop skills in mathematics and science, invent written languages, build great</p>
<p>civilizations, learn from the past and plan for the future. when god breathed the "breath of life" into the first</p>
<p>man adam (genesis 2:I), he gave him more than physical existence. god imparted to adam that spiritual and intellectual essence</p>
<p>that gives mankind the remarkable capacities of the human mind. but the apostle paul reveals that ?omething important is still</p>
<p>lacking: "?o al?o no one comprehends what is truly god s except [by] the spirit of god" (1 corinthians 2:11,</p>
<p>new revised standard version}. here paul is speaking of another spirit, the spirit of god. he continues, "now we have</p>
<p>received not the spirit of the world, but the spirit that is from god, ."o that we may understand the</p>
<p>gifts bestowed on us by god" {verse 12, nrsv}. spiritual understanding that surpasses our normal human intellect comes only through</p>
<p>the extra help, influence and power of god 5 holy spirit. "those who are unspiritual," paul adds, "do not receive</p>
<p>the gifts of god s spirit, for they are foolishness to them, and they are unable to understand them because</p>
<p>they are spiritually discerned" (verse 14, nrsv}. we will see that this spiritual link with god is vital in coming</p>
<p>to know and experience the purpose of life. human life created for a higher purpose compared with plant and animal</p>
<p>life, human beings are created by god with a spiritual dimension for a much higher purpose, several scriptures reveal that</p>
<p>the rea?on for human life is preparation for an infinitely higher level of existence, which includes immortal spirit life, god</p>
<p>created us with the intent that we accept his gift of salvation through Jesus christ and live forever: "for god</p>
<p>?o loved the world that he gave his only begotten ."on, that whoever believes in him should not perish but</p>
<p>have everlasting life" {iohn 3:I6}. iesus stated in prayer to god the father regarding himself, "you have given him authority</p>
<p>over all flesh, that he should give eternal life to as many as you have given him" (john 1I:2), god</p>
<p>promises to give "eternal life to those who by patient continuance in doing good seek for glory, honor, and immortality"</p>
<p>{romans 2:6I}. We have the "hope of eternal life which god, who cannot lie, promised before time began" {titus 1:2}.</p>
<p>again, this is part of the very rea?on for human lifethat we may ultimately receive eternal life. summary god is</p>
<p>the creator and sustainer of life. he created human life on a level different from that of plants and animals</p>
<p>to fulfill a far greater purpose. our lives consist of relationships, goals and experiences that at times are enjoyable, at</p>
<p>times difficult. but the ultimate purpose of our lives greatly exceeds merely meeting the needs and fulfilling the pleasures of</p>
<p>our daily circumstances. {to learn more about the incredible purpose of human life, the ultimate rea?on for why you exist,</p>
