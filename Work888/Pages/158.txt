<p>required documentation, "i am proposing the abolishment of the existing caste system on vesturon with regards to high born citizens</p>
<p>and the taking of a mate. currently, the convenant exists that disallows high born citizens to court or mate with</p>
<p>those who were born under less fortunate circumstances. our convenants have always tried to benefit the commoner, as well as</p>
<p>the high born, and yet this caste system still exists. it is a contradiction to what vesturon is and what</p>
<p>it stands for. my proposal would allow high born citizens the right to mingle, court and even mate with commoners.</p>
<p>and the same would be true for commoners." when i finished, the elders all gaped at me. one of them</p>
<p>finally sputtered, "why that is preposterous!" there were a multitude of elders agreeing with the one who spoke. another one</p>
<p>piped in, "that would dilute our bloodlines!" "first off, the high borns could still be required to mate with vesturions</p>
<p>thereby keeping our bloodlines undiluted. but if i may ask you, would it not benefit our race to introduce new</p>
<p>bloodlines into it?" i ventured into an area that was rarely discussed. oh the horror that descended on their faces.</p>
<p>i should have kept my mouth shut on that last comment. "how dare you even suggest such a thing!" "please,</p>
<p>allow me to explain. we could stipulate that there has to be some vesturion blood in said person... they cannot</p>
<p>be a complete and total alien. for example, if a high born vesturion desired to mate with a human, and</p>
<p>the human had some amount of vesturion blood, it would be allowed. but if the human had none, well, only</p>
<p>then would it be prohibited." "i speak for the maiority here when i say that this must be deliberated before</p>
<p>we can hand down our decision. however, speaking for myself, i must say i am quite shocked by your request,</p>
<p>my lord. of all the requests we receive, this has to be the most shocking i have ever heard." the</p>
<p>elder who spoke was a pinched-faced male. "i apologize if i have offended anyone here. that was certainly not my</p>
<p>intent. i was of the mind that if we considered ourselves a society for the good of evenone, we must</p>
<p>apply that to evenone in the population. we cannot continue to have these dichotomous rules in place when, in fact,</p>
<p>they simply don t fit anymore." "yes, i see. we will take the rest of today to deliberate and you</p>
<p>will have your answer in the morning, my liege." "thank you, council. until then." i bowed to them and left.</p>
<p>worry, it would be difficult enough communicating with her telepathically, trying to hide my feelings over the matter. as it</p>
<p>was, she knew immediately i was not pleased with the outcome. morning could not arrive soon enough, although i dreaded</p>
<p>it as well. when my time approached, i quickly made my way to the council chambers. my fears were confirmed</p>
<p>when they adamantly denied my request. what made it even worse was now it was all over aurora that i</p>
<p>had made the request. my father was most disconcerted over the whole process and agonized over how it all would</p>
<p>affect my reputation. "i must continue this and i will pursue it with a vengeance," i informed him. "i supposed</p>
<p>the damage is done," he said deiectedly. much to our surprise, we began to receive reports throughout the land of</p>
<p>supporters for my cause, they were from commoners and high born alike, insisting how right i was in my request.</p>
<p>i was visiting annalise when she said, "your supporters are gaining momentum. they are catching the notice of people evenwhere</p>
<p>from all the lands," "annalise, it is inspiring me. tomorrow, i plan to request another audience with the council and</p>
<p>present my proposal again." her eyes brightened and i declared my resolve. the next morning as i prepared to leave,</p>
<p>a group of guardians made a visit to the palace, requesting my presence. i entered the reception room where we</p>
<p>usually received official visitors. my father and mother were there, along with the group of six guardians. as i began</p>
<p>to greet them, i noticed the stricken looks on my parents faces. "what? what is it?" i asked, my pulse</p>
<p>racing. "annalise has been taken," my father began. "what." i roared. "where is she." i must go to her!" "we</p>
<p>do not know where she is. she has been kidnapped and is being held by a group of zealots. they</p>
<p>are demanding you give up this mission of yours, rowan. they do not like what is happening throughout our land."</p>
<p>my father s lips were pursed with suppressed fury. "tell me eventhing... now!" my eyes blazed with murderous intent. i</p>
<p>would stop at nothing to get her back, but i needed all the details. "she was taken this morning as</p>
<p>she made her way to work, they sent us this missive with the demands." as i read the image before</p>
<p>me, i felt the blood drain from my face. they had included a photo image of her, bound and gagged.</p>
<p>her face was bloodied and bruised and i could tell she had been crying, as there were tracks of tears</p>
<p>upon her cheeks. my /"aw clenched and i ground my teeth. my first inclination was to race off to find</p>
<p>her, but i needed to formulate a plan. "we need to locate her. i want even tracking expert on this</p>
<p>now. look at this image and dissect it and see what can be ascertained. go now!" i commanded the guardians.</p>
<p>i dashed to the transcom in the room and called up the guardian headquarters, informing the commander of what had</p>
<p>transpired. "i want even available guardian placed on this immediately. order them to report in if you must. we must</p>
<p>have some information on this group. i want to know who their leader is, where they operate, and what their</p>
<p>agenda usually consists of. and i want this information yesterday," i commanded with authority. "yes, my liege." "i will</p>
