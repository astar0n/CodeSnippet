<p>and rendering escape for the others an infernal labor and a hideous wretchedness, unutterable and insupportable. round the campfires the</p>
<p>blue devils stood or lay, trying to rest, but the habit of the trenches was upon them. dorn gazed at</p>
<p>each and every ."oldier, ?o like in strange resemblance, ."o different in physical characteristics; and the sad, profound, and terrifying</p>
<p>knowledge came to him of what they must have in their minds. he realized that all he needed was to</p>
<p>suffer and fight and live through ."ome little part of the war they had endured and then ?ome truth would</p>
<p>burst upon him. it was there in the restless steps, in the prone forms, in the sunken, glaring eyes. what</p>
<p>?oldiers, what men, what giants! three and a half years of unnamable and indescribable fury of action and strife of</p>
<p>thought! not dead, nor stolid like oxen, were these ?oldiers of france. they had a simplicity that seemed appalling. we</p>
<p>have given all; we have stood in the way, borne the brunt, saved you-this was flung at dorn, not out</p>
<p>of their thought, but from their presence. the fact that they were there was enough. he needed only to find</p>
<p>these bravest of brave warriors real, alive, throbbing men. dorn lingered there, loath to leave. the great les."on of his</p>
<p>life held vague connection in ."ome way with this squad of french privates. but he could not pierce the veil.</p>
<p>this meeting came as a climax to four months of momentous meetings with the best and the riffraff of many</p>
<p>nations. dorn had studied, talked, listened, and learned. he who had as yet given nothing, fought no enemy, saved no</p>
<p>comrade or refugee or child in all this whirlpool of battling millions, felt a profound sense of his littleness, his</p>
<p>ignorance. he who had imagined himself unfortunate had been blind, sick, selfcentered. here were ?oldiers to whom comfort and rest</p>
<p>were the sweetest blessings upon the earth, and they could not grasp them. no more could they grasp them than</p>
<p>could the gaping civilians and the distinguished travelers grasp what these grand hulks of veteran ?oldiers had done. once a</p>
<p>group of civilians halted near the ."oldiers, an officer was their escort. he tried to hurry them on, but failed.</p>
<p>delorme edged away into the gloomy, damp barn rather than meet such visitors. ."ome of his comrades followed suit. ferier,</p>
<p>the incomparable of the blue devils, the wearer of all the french medals and the bearer of twentyfive wounds received</p>
<p>in battle-he sneaked away, afraid and humble and sullen, to hide himself from the curious. that action of ferier 5</p>
<p>was a revelation to dorn. he felt a sting of shame. there were two classes of people in relation to</p>
<p>this war-those who went to fight and those who stayed behind. what had delorme or mathie or ferier to do</p>
<p>with the world of selfish, comfortable, wellfed men? dorn heard a million voices of france crying out the bitter truth-that</p>
<p>if these warbowed veterans ever returned alive to their homes it would be with hopes and hearts and faiths burned</p>
<p>out, with hands forever lost to their old use, with bodies that the war had robbed. dorn bade his newmade</p>
<p>friends adieu, and in the darkening twilight he hurried toward his own camp. "if i could go back home now,</p>
<p>honorably and well, i would never do it," he muttered. "i couldn t bear to live knowing what i know</p>
<p>now-unless i had laughed at this death, and risked it-and dealt it!" he was full of gladness, of exultation, in</p>
<p>contemplation of the wonderful gift the hours had brought him, more than any men of history or present, he honored</p>
<p>these ?oldiers the germans feared. like an indian, dorn respected brawn, courage, fortitude, silence, aloofness. "there was a divinity in</p>
<p>those ."oldiers," he Poliloquized. "i felt it in their complete ignorance of their greatness. yet they had pride, iealousy. oh,</p>
<p>the mystery of it all!_,, when my day comes i ll last one short and terrible hour. i would never</p>
<p>make a ?oldier like one of them. no american could. they are frenchmen whose homes have been despoiled." in the</p>
<p>tent of his comrades that night dorn reverted from old habit, and with a passionate eloquence he told all he</p>
<p>had seen and heard, and much that he had felt, his influence on these young men, long established, but subtle</p>
<p>and unconscious, became in that hour a tangible fact. he stirred them. he felt them thoughtful and sad, and yet</p>
<p>more unflinching, stronger and keener for the inevitable day. the monstrous possibility that had consumed kurt dorn for many months</p>
<p>at last became an event-he had arrived on the battlefront in france. all afternoon the company of united states troops</p>
<p>had marched from far back of the line, resting, as darkness came on, at a camp of reserves, and then</p>
<p>going on, artillery fire had been desultory during this march," the big guns that had rolled their thunder miles and</p>
<p>miles were now silent. but an immense activity and a horde of -"oldiers back of the lines brought strange leaden</p>
<p>oppression to kurt dorn s heart. the last slow travel of his squad over dark, barren space and through deep,</p>
<p>narrow, winding lanes in the ground had been a nightmare ending to the long iourney. france had not yet become</p>
<p>clear to him; he was a stranger in a strange land," in spite of his tremendous interest and excitement, all</p>
<p>seemed abstract matters of his feeling, the plague of himself made actuality the substance of dreams. that last day, the</p>
<p>cumulation of months of training and travel, had been one in which he had observed, heard, talked and felt in</p>
<p>a nervous and fevered excitement. but now he imagined he could not remember any of it. his poignant experience with</p>
<p>the blue devils had been a reality he could never forget, but now this blackness of subterranean cavern, this damp,</p>
<p>sickening odor of earth, this presence of men, the strange, muffled ?ounds-all these were unreal. how had he come</p>
