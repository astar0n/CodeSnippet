<p>ve seen so far, going through systems reports will be the least of your worries." there was a touch of</p>
<p>gravity in her statement. i could only guess at the mess we were in. as i sat down at tolson</p>
<p>s desk, my disdain for desk work waved a scolding finger. i promised myself it would only be temporary. ann-marie</p>
<p>s reports were already listed on the screen. i started with propulsion and worked my way down through nav, life</p>
<p>support, communications, networking, and all that followed. the reports were substantial. the motivation of the crew was beyond what anyone</p>
<p>could have expected. they must have barely left the aft section when they reported for duty. the problem was it</p>
<p>was seriously bad. the aliens had attacked the hard wiring that ran from the various control rooms to the peripheral</p>
<p>devices at the other end. these were the lines that ran through all the most difficult and remote areas of</p>
<p>the ship. the wire-type connections had been fried, the cabling no longer any good. even worse, the fiber cables had</p>
<p>somehow been overheated so that the glass in the lines was distorted and unusable. we had communications within the ship,</p>
<p>but all lines leading to dishes or antennae were destroyed. we could eventually repair and reboot the necessary computer systems,</p>
<p>but we could not communicate with the equipment they controlled. it was the end result of what the aliens had</p>
<p>first begun. we had been forced to control our gravity manually. we had planned to start our engines manually. they</p>
<p>had been destroying our interfacing before we even knew they were there. had that been the worst of it, we</p>
<p>would have had a chance. unfortunately, looming beyond those problems was the loss of air and water. we knew more</p>
<p>than half of both had been taken. the final inventory had not been completed yet, mainly because many of the</p>
<p>sensor lines were no longer working. when the reports came in, the air and water levels would tell us how</p>
<p>long we had to live, replacement department heads for those missing needed to be appointed, and then a staff meeting</p>
<p>scheduled to reconstitute upper management. the captain had said that distress beacons were already sent out, but the chances that</p>
<p>they were blocked were great. we could not pop out in the escape pods. we were too far from anything,</p>
<p>and it was doubtful anyone was coming for us. i put my elbow on the desk and rubbed my forehead.</p>
<p>we needed to go home. to do that, we needed to go to light. somehow, we had to go to</p>
<p>light. i pushed back in my chair and took a deep breath. at the door, i asked ann-marie to arrange</p>
<p>a department flow chart for me with all the missing or out of action people co-notated. she gave me the</p>
<p>already done reply, and pointed me back to my desk. in a way, filling the missing positions wasn t too</p>
<p>difficult. since i did not know many of them, i had to take the highest available name on each chart</p>
<p>and bump them up. in cases where i could, i used the people who had been so proactive in our</p>
<p>recovery from the unthinkable. in one of life s many ironies, maureen brandon had survived the ordeal. i had ann-marie</p>
<p>schedule a staff meeting. the only minor item still needed, was a plan. they arrived at least forty-five minutes early.</p>
<p>we squeezed evenone in and let the doors shut. i did not have to ask for silence. it was already</p>
<p>there. "so, i ve gone over your status reports. great /"ob, by the way. i don t quite know how</p>
<p>all of you managed to do that much so quickly, but thank-you. obviously we need to address the most pressing</p>
<p>issues beginning with life support. mr. leaman, is there any further updates on critical expendables?" "we know it s less</p>
<p>than three months worth of air and water. we began the trip with roughly twelve months of supplies, twice what</p>
<p>we needed, so they transferred a hell of a lot, before they were stopped. we probably should expect no more</p>
<p>than two months of normal use expendables, so rationing should begin immediately." "when do you expect the final figures?" "sometime</p>
<p>in the next four hours. the crews have some climbing around to do." "please let me know as soon as</p>
<p>that comes in." "doctor, your current status?" doctor pacell looked exhausted. clearly he hadn t got the same break i</p>
<p>had. he straightened up and tried to appear composed. "the victims of the alien assaults are being kept in suspension</p>
<p>in a storage compartment we ve converted for that purpose. i am monitoring that area continuously. otherwise, we have no</p>
<p>critical cases. perk holloway is stable and doing very well. i see no medical reasons he won t recover fully</p>
<p>after a long internment period. our other cases range from miscellaneous iniuries, to psychological stress. all of those are in</p>
<p>treatment and controlled." "do you have eventhing you need, doctor?" "considering how many people have been variously affected, we are</p>
<p>doing okay supply wise. i ll let you know if that changes." "okay. propulsion, we re ready for the bad</p>
<p>news." paul kusama stood up and leaned forward on the table. "our tachyon drives are perfectly healthy. our amplights are</p>
<p>perfectly healthy. our interface from main control is damaged beyond repair. we can still only give you manual control of</p>
<p>both engine sets, it s a shipyard type of [ob to fix this." he sat back down and folded his</p>
<p>arms, with an expression that suggested it was not his fault. "well getting right to the point, has a manual</p>
<p>iump to light ever actually been done?" without looking up, he shook his head. "not to my knowledge." "i know</p>
<p>the basics of it, but give us a run down on the problems." leaman took the question. "there s a</p>
<p>shock wave going into light, and it s not just a sonic-boom type of thing. it s more like</p>
