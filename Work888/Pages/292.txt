<p>signs of his peaceful togetherness with allah. whenever he was happy about something or when he received happy news he</p>
<p>would prostrate[-42% and pray[43J in order to thank allah for this bounty. in the event of extraordinary events such as</p>
<p>a solar or lunar ec ipse he woul immediately bow down in the face of such divine manifestations of magnificence. [44]when</p>
<p>he had a need to ask for from allah he would again perform the prayer, in the blessed month of</p>
<p>ramadan the messenger of allah became even more spiritual with the worship he performed such as the tarawih prayers, his</p>
<p>itikaf {seclusion}, and the generosity in giving out of the messenger of allah. after ramadan he would continue to perform</p>
<p>from time to time supererogatory fasting. he would especially choose to fast on mondays and thursdays and he would explain</p>
<p>the reason as follows: "it is on mondays and thursdays that the deeds of a person are presented to allah</p>
<p>most high, i like to have my deeds presented while i am fasting", (tirmidhi, savm, 44/I4I}. on the 13th, 14th</p>
<p>and 15th days of the hijri month called the days of white {due to the full moon) he would take</p>
<p>care to fast and advised his companions to do the same "the prophet would fast on the days of the</p>
<p>full moon in both war and peace and would never abandon this practice". (nasai, savm, I0) allah s messenger would</p>
<p>spend six days of the month of shawwal fasting[45] and would fast the ashura fast on the Ith and 10th</p>
<p>or the 10-I1th days of the month of muharrem. the prophet would explain the virtues of the greater and lesser</p>
<p>pilgrimages {ha}! and umrah} and he would be in a state of constant remembrance, and would never cease his praise,</p>
<p>glorification and asking for forgiveness. he would sacrifice an animal for himself and for those in his community who could</p>
<p>not afford to. [4I] what is meant by prostration is generally the ritual prayer or salat. in that case those</p>
<p>who want to enter paradise and be a neighbour of the beloved of allah should pray much and increase their</p>
<p>prostrations which are moments of closeness with allah. the station of the prophet muhammad tpbuh} in paradise is greater than</p>
<p>that of all the other prophets. so if one desires to be close to the prophet in paradise, one should</p>
<p>act in accordance with the sunnah and in particular, perform much ritual prayer {salat} in deep reverence. on the day</p>
<p>that khaybar was conquered a man came to the prophet and said: "o messenger of allah, today i have made</p>
<p>such a profit the likes of which none of the people of this valley have seen" the prophet aksed him:</p>
<p>"what did you earn?" the companion replied: "i continued to buy and sell without stopping so much so that i</p>
<p>earned 300 ukiyye". [48] in response to this the prophet (pbuh} said: "shall i tell you something that is the</p>
<p>best of profits?" the companion replied: "what is that o messenger of allah?" the prophet gave the following response: the</p>
<p>messenger of allah (pbuh} asked: "shall i tell you something that has a faster return and brings more booty?" and</p>
<p>then continued: "if a man takes his ablution properly and then arrives at the mosque, and prays his dawn prayer</p>
<p>and follows it up with two cycles of the midmorning prayer, then this man will have made a much faster</p>
<p>return and will have gained much more". "if you pray two cycles of the late-morning prayer you will not be</p>
<p>written as amongst the ignorant; if you pray 4 cycles you will be written as a worshipper; if you pray</p>
<p>6" cycles, allah will meet all of your needs; if you pray 8 cycles you will be recorded as a</p>
<p>qanitin (one who does much worship}; if you perchance pray 10 cycles, a house will be built for you in</p>
<p>paradise". there is no day, nor no night, and no second even in which allah most high does not bestow</p>
<p>upon his servants what they wish and favours them. allah most high has not bestowed a bounty upon any of</p>
<p>his slaves greater than the inspiration of his remembrance in his heart", (haysami, ii, 236; ali al-muttaki, vii, 80I/21511). one</p>
<p>time the messenger of allah (pbuh) said to bilal {fa}: "o bilal! which of your worship is it that you</p>
<p>performed after you became muslim that you hope for the most reward from? because i heard the sounds of your</p>
<p>shoes ahead of me in paradise". bilal replied: "after i have taken my ablution i pray as much prayer as</p>
<p>i can, day and night, this is the worship that i hope for the most reward from". (bukhari, taha/iud 1I,</p>
<p>tawheed 4I, fadailus sahaba I08}. allah s messenger saw bilal in his dream walking ahead of him in paradise. almighty</p>
<p>allah showed the prophet this dream to inform us of the importance of supererogatory prayers, one day abu qatada came</p>
<p>to the mosque of the prophet. when he saw the blessed prophet sitting amongst his companions he went and sat</p>
<p>next to him. upon this allah s messenger turned to abu qatada and said: "what prevented you from praying two</p>
<p>cycles of prayer before you sat down?" abu qatade replied: whenever the companions needed anything or whenever they were in</p>
<p>distress they immediately prayed supererogatory prayers and sought refuge with allah. one summer s day the gardener of anas (fa)</p>
<p>came to him and complained that it had not rained and that the garden had withered. anas asked for some</p>
<p>water and took his ablution following which he performed the prayer, after he finished, he asked the gardener: "do you</p>
<p>see anything in the sky?" the gardener replied: "no i do not", anas {ra} went back inside and continued to</p>
<p>pray, he asked again for the third or the fourth time: "can you see anything in the sky?" the gardener</p>
<p>answered: "i can see a cloud the size of a bird s wing". upon this anas continued his prayer</p>
