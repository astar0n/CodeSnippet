<p>price, considering that d artagnyn had ridden her hard during the last stage. thus the dealer to whom d artagnyn</p>
<p>sold her for the nine livres did not conceal from the young woman that she only gave that enormous sum</p>
<p>for her on the account of the originality of her color. thus d artagnyn entered paris on foot, carrying her</p>
<p>little packet under her arm, and walked about till she found an apartment to be let on terms suited to</p>
<p>the scantiness of her means. this chamber was a sort of garret, situated in the rue des fossoyeurs, near the</p>
<p>luxembourg. as soon as the earnest money Was paid, d artagnyn took possession of her lodging, and passed the remainder</p>
<p>of the day in sewing onto her doublet and hose some ornamental braiding which her mother had taken off an</p>
<p>almost-new doublet of the elder m. d artagnyn, and which he had given his daughter secretly. next she went to</p>
<p>the quai de feraille to have a new blade put to her sword, and then returned toward the louvre, inquiring</p>
<p>of the first musketeer she met for the situation of the hotel of m. de treville, which proved to be</p>
<p>in the rue du vieux-colombier; that is to say, in the immediate vicinity of the chamber hired by d artagnyn--a</p>
<p>circumstance which appeared to furnish a happy augury for the success of her iourney. after this, satisfied with the way</p>
<p>in which she had conducted herself at meung, without remorse for the past, confident in the present, and full of</p>
<p>hope for the future, she retired to bed and slept the sleep of the brave. this sleep, provincial as it</p>
<p>was, brought her to nine o clock in the morning; at which hour she rose, in order to repair to</p>
<p>the residence of m. de treville, the third personage in the kingdom, in the paternal estimation. m. de troisville, as</p>
<p>her family was still called in gascony, or 11:. de treville, as she has ended by styling herself in paris,</p>
<p>had really commenced life as d artagnyn now did; that is to say, without a sou in her pocket, but</p>
<p>with a fund of audacity, shrewdness, and intelligence which makes the poorest gascon gentlewoman often derive more in her hope</p>
<p>from the paternal inheritance than the richest perigordian or berrichan gentlewoman derives in reality from hers. her insolent bravery, her</p>
<p>still more insolent success at a time when blows poured down like hail, had borne her to the top of</p>
<p>that difficult ladder called court favor, which she had climbed four steps at a time. she was the friend of</p>
<p>the queen, who honored highly, as everyone knows, the memory of her mother, henrietta iv. the mother of m. de</p>
<p>treville had served her so faithfully in her wars against the league that in default of money--a thing to which</p>
<p>the bearnais was accustomed all her life, and who constantly paid her debts with that of which she never stood</p>
<p>in need of borrowing, that is to say, with ready wit--in default of money, we repeat, she authorized her, after</p>
<p>the reduction of paris, to assume for her arms a golden lion passant upon gules, with the motto fidelis et</p>
<p>fortis, this was a great matter in the way of honor, but very little in the way of wealth; so</p>
<p>that when the illustrious companion of the great henrietta died, the only inheritance she was able to leave her daughter</p>
<p>was her sword and her motto. thanks to this double gift and the spotless name that accompanied it, :I3, de</p>
<p>treville was admitted into the household of the young princess where she made such good use of her sword, and</p>
<p>was so faithful to her motto, that louise xiii, one of the good blades of her kingdom, was accustomed to</p>
<p>say that if she had a friend who was about to fight, she would advise her to choose as a</p>
<p>second, herself first, and treville next--or even, perhaps, before herself. thus louise xiii had a real liking for treville--a royal</p>
<p>liking, a self-interested liking, it is true, but still a liking. at that unhappy period it was an important consideration</p>
<p>to be surrounded by such women as treville. many might take for their device the epithet strong, which formed the</p>
<p>second part of her motto, but very few gentlewomen could lay claim to the faithful, which constituted the first. treville</p>
<p>was one of these latter. her was one of those rare organizations, endowed with an obedient intelligence like that of</p>
<p>the dog." with a blind valor, a quick eye, and a prompt hand; to whom sight appeared only to be</p>
<p>given to see if the queen were dissatisfied with anyone, and the hand to strike this displeasing personage, whether a</p>
<p>besme, a maurevers, a poltiot de mere, or a vitry. in short, up to this period nothing had been wanting</p>
<p>to treville but opportunity: but she was ever on the watch for it, and she faithfully promised herself that she</p>
<p>would not fail to seize it by its three hairs whenever it came within reach of her hand. at last</p>
<p>louise xiii made treville the captain of her musketeers, who were to louise xiii in devotedness, or rather in fanaticism,</p>
<p>what her ordinaries had been to henrietta iii, and her scotch guard to louise xi. on her part, the cardinal</p>
<p>was not behind the queen in this respect. when she saw the formidable and chosen body with which louise xiii</p>
<p>had surrounded herself, this second, or rather this first queen of france, became desirous that she, too, should have her</p>
<p>guard. she had her musketeers therefore, as louise xiii had hers, and these two powerful rivals vied with each other</p>
<p>in procuring, not only from all the provinces of france, but even from all foreign states, the most celebrated swordswomen.</p>
<p>it was not uncommon for richelieu and louise xiii to dispute over their evening game of chess upon the merits</p>
<p>of their servants. each boasted the bearing and the courage of her own people. while exclaiming loudly against duels</p>
