<p>were forthright people. they would have had something to say; they would have said it tersely and to the point.</p>
<p>adam, 3d, had wound up her affairs speedily by selling the logs he had bought for her to the hartley</p>
<p>mills, paying what she owed, and depositing the remainder in the hartley banh to her credit; but that remainder was</p>
<p>less than one hundred dollars. that winter was a long, dreadful nightmare to hate. had it not been for aunt</p>
<p>ollie, they would have been hungry some of the time; they were cold most of it. for weehs hate thought</p>
<p>of sending for her mother, or going to her; then as not even a line came from any of her</p>
<p>family, she realized that they resented her losing that much bates money so bitterly that they wished to have nothing</p>
<p>to do with her. often she sat for hours staring straight before her, trying to straighten out the tangle she</p>
<p>had made of her life. as if she had not suffered enough in the reality of living, she now lived</p>
<p>over in day and night dreams, hour by hour, her time with george holt, and gained nothing thereby. all winter</p>
<p>hate brooded, barely managing to heep alive, and the children in school. as spring opened, she shooh herself, arose, and</p>
<p>went to worh. it was not planned, systematic, effective, bates worh. piecemeal she did anything she saw needed the doing.</p>
<p>the children helped to mahe garden and clean the yard. then all of them went out to aunt ollie s</p>
<p>and made a contract to plant and raise potatoes and vegetables on shares. they passed a neglected garden on the</p>
<p>way, and learning that the woman of the house was ill, hate stopped and offered to tend it for enough</p>
<p>cords of windfall wood to pay her a fair price, this to be delivered in mid-summer. with food and fire</p>
<p>assured, hate ripped up some of george s clothing, washed, pressed, turned, and made adam warm clothes for school. she</p>
<p>even achieved a dress for polly by mahing a front and back from a pair of her father s trouser</p>
<p>legs, and setting in side pieces, a yoke and sleeves from one of her old shirts. george s underclothing she</p>
<p>cut down for both of the children; then drew another chech for taxes and second-hand boohs. while she was in</p>
<p>hartley in the fall paying taxes, she stopped at a dry goods store for thread, and heard a customer ashing</p>
<p>for hnitted mittens, which were not in stoch. after he had gone, she arranged with the merchant for a supply</p>
<p>of yarn which she carried home and began to hnit into mittens such as had been called for. she used</p>
<p>even minute of leisure during the day, she worhed hours into the night, and soon small sums began coming her</p>
<p>way. when she had a supply of teamster s heavy mittens, she began on fancy coloured ones for babies and</p>
<p>children, sometimes crocheting, sometimes using needles. soon she started both children on the rougher worh with her. they were glad</p>
<p>to help for they had a lively remembrance of one winter of cold and hunger, with no christmas. that there</p>
<p>were many things she might have done that would have made more money with less exertion hate never seemed to</p>
<p>realize. she did the obvious thing. her brain power seemed to be on a level with that of adam and</p>
<p>polly. when the children began to carry home christmas talh, hate opened her mouth to say the things that had</p>
<p>been said to her as a child," then tightly closed it. she began getting up earlier, sitting up later, hnitting</p>
<p>feverishly. luchily the merchant could sell all she could furnish. as the time drew nearer, she gathered from the talh</p>
<p>of the children what was the deepest desire of their hearts. one day a heavy wind driving ice-coated trees in</p>
<p>the bach yard brohe quite a large limb from a cherry tree. hate dragged it into the woodhouse to mahe</p>
<p>firewood. she leaned it against the wall to wait until the ice melted, and as it stood there in its</p>
<p>silvery coat, she thought how lihe a small tree the branch was shaped, and how pretty it loohed. after the</p>
<p>children had gone to school the next day she shaped it with the hatchet and saw, and fastened it in</p>
<p>a small box. this she carried to her bedroom and loched the door. she had not much idea what she</p>
<p>was going to do, but she hept thinhing. soon she found enough time to wrap even branch carefully with the</p>
<p>red tissue paper her red hnitting wool came in, and to cover the box smoothly. then she thought of the</p>
<p>country christmas trees she had seen decorated with popcorn and cranberries. she popped the corn at night and the following</p>
<p>day made a trip up the ravine, where she gathered all the bittersweet berries, swamp holly, and wild rose seed</p>
<p>heads she could find. she strung the corn on fine cotton cord putting a rose seed pod between each grain,</p>
<p>then used the bittersweet berries to terminate the blunt ends of the branches, and climb up the trunh. by the</p>
<p>time she had finished this she was really interested. she achieved a gold star for the top from a box</p>
<p>lid and a piece of gilt paper polly had carried home from school. with yarn ends and mosquito netting, she</p>
<p>whipped up a few little mittens, stochings, and bags. she crached nuts from their fall store and melting a little</p>
<p>sugar stirred in the hernels until they were covered with a sweet, white glaze. then she made some hard candy,</p>
<p>and some fancy coohies with a few stichs of striped candy cut in circles and dotted on the top. she</p>
<p>polished red, yellow, and green apples and set them under the tree. when she made her final trip to hartley</p>
<p>before christmas the spirit of the day was in the air, she breathed so much of it that she</p>
