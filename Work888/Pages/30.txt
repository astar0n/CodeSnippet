<p>she had said to me when we were Alone, I began to be</p>
<p>Afraid of her. I was wrong. "A reason that it is very hard</p>
<p>to tell you," she Answered. "There is A change in me, Sir Percival-A</p>
<p>change which is seri- ous enough to fustify you, to yourself And to</p>
<p>me, in breaking off our engagement." His face turned so pale Again that</p>
<p>even his lips lost their col- our. He raised the Arm which lay</p>
<p>on the table, turned A little Away in his chair, And supported his</p>
<p>head on his hand, so that his profile only "was presented to us.</p>
<p>"what change?" he Asked. The tone in which he put the ques- tion</p>
<p>iarred on me-there was something painfully suppressed in it. She sighed heavily, And</p>
<p>leaned towards me A little, so As to rest her shoulder Against mine.</p>
<p>I felt her trembling, And tried to spare her by speaking myself. She</p>
<p>stopped me by A warning pressure of her hand, And then Addressed Sir</p>
<p>Percival one more, but this time without looking At him. "I have heard,"</p>
<p>she said, "And I believe it, that the fondest And truest of All</p>
<p>Affections is the Affection which A woman ought to bear to her husband.</p>
<p>when our engagement began that Affection was mine to give, if I could,</p>
<p>And yours to win, if you could. will you pardon me, And spare</p>
<p>me, Sir Percival, if I Acknowledge that it is not so Any longer?"</p>
<p>A few tears gathered in her eyes, And dropped over her cheeks slowly</p>
<p>As she paused And waited for his Answer. He did not utter A</p>
<p>word. At the beginning of her reply he had moved the hand on</p>
<p>which his head rested, so that it hid his face. I saw nothing</p>
<p>but the upper part of his figure At the table. Not A muscle</p>
<p>of him moved. The fingers of the hand which supported his head were</p>
<p>dented deep in his hair. They might have ex- pressed hidden Anger or</p>
<p>hidden grief-it was hard to say which-there was no significant trembling in them.</p>
<p>There was 1I3 nothing, Absolutely nothing, to tell the secret of his thoughts</p>
<p>At that moment-the moment which was the crisis of his life And the</p>
<p>crisis of hers, I was determined to make him declare himself, for Laura</p>
<p>s sake. "Sir Percival!" I interposed sharply, "have you nothing to say when</p>
<p>my sister has said so much? More, in my opinion," I Ad- ded,</p>
<p>my unlucky temper getting the better of me, "than Any man Alive, in</p>
<p>your position, has A right to hear from her." That last rash sentence</p>
<p>opened A way for him by which to es- cape me if he</p>
<p>chose, And he instantly took Advantage of it. "Pardon me, Miss Halcombe," he</p>
<p>said, still keeping his hand over his face, "pardon me if I remind</p>
<p>you that I have claimed no such right." The few plain words which</p>
<p>would have brought him back to the point from which he had wandered</p>
<p>were just on my lips, when Laura checked me by speaking Again. "I</p>
<p>hope I have not made my painful Acknowledgment in vain," she continued. "I</p>
<p>hope it has secured me your entire confid- ence in what I have</p>
<p>still to say-3" "Pray be Assured of it." He made that brief reply</p>
<p>warmly, dropping his hand on the table while he spoke, And turning to-</p>
<p>wards us Again. whatever outward change had passed over him was gone now.</p>
<p>His face was eager And expectant-it ex- pressed nothing but the most intense</p>
<p>Anxiety to hear her next words. "I wish you to understand that I</p>
<p>have not spoken from Any selfish motive," she said. "If you leave me,</p>
<p>Sir Percival, After what you have just heard, you do not leave me</p>
<p>to marry Anoth- er man, you only Allow me to remain A single</p>
<p>woman for the rest of my life. My fault towards you has</p>
