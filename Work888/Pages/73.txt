<p>called ken. oh shit. then she realized that a thirtyish woman was running down west eleventh street toward them, carrying</p>
<p>a dark green backpack in her left hand. they "were gesturing for her to come to them and get into</p>
<p>the vehicle, though she didn t appear to see them yet. halfway down the block behind her, a man in</p>
<p>a tan flight iacket was running, calling out. "kristen, wait i just want to talk-" the running woman glanced over</p>
<p>her shoulder at him and, at that moment collided with bartlett s flunky. as she recoiled from the impact the</p>
<p>red-haired woman seized her left arm. "kirby, come," the woman said. "you re not well. we ll take you back."</p>
<p>"no!" she yelled, and twisted free of the woman s grasp. but now the iapanese guy had grabbed her other</p>
<p>arm. "it s going to be all right," he said as he Caught the top of her head and started</p>
<p>shoving her through the open door of the navigator. "you shouldn t go out alone." at that moment the man</p>
<p>in the tan flight iacket reached the scene. it was stone, but he d been moments too late. he stretched</p>
<p>his arm into the lincoln and tried to take the girl s hand. "kristen, don t go with them. i</p>
<p>just need to talk-" "you don t need to do anything, pal," the man called ken declared. "except get out</p>
<p>of the way." he chopped the side of stone s neck with an open hand, sending him sprawling backwards onto</p>
<p>the pavement, flight iacket askew. now something odd was going on. another girl was running down the sidewalk. "kristy, wait.</p>
<p>don t . . ." but the redheaded woman had already gotten into the back seat of the suv, beside</p>
<p>the girl, and the iapanese man was heading around the front. three seconds later, he was behind the wheel and</p>
<p>peeling out. they Were gone. ally sat watching, stunned. but now a chevy sedan was departing a parking space three</p>
<p>cars down from where she was and she quickly pulled in. by then stone aimes had picked himself up off</p>
<p>the sidewalk and was gazing wistfully in the direction of the vanishing lincoln. the girl who d been behind him</p>
<p>stopped and was talking to him. ally quickly locked the toyota and went over. "but why did she run?" stone</p>
<p>aimes was asking. he was disheveled but then being slugged and knocked to the sidewalk takes a toll on anybody</p>
<p>s poise. "she didn t know who you were," the girl replied she looked like she would have been more</p>
<p>at home in the east village than here: late twenties, tattoo on one bicep, eyebrows pierced blue ieans, hair needing</p>
<p>a better day. she had serious acne scars on her cheeks. "i think she thought you were them, whoever they</p>
<p>were." ally looked stone over and felt a surge of admiration. in spite of the fact he just got decked,</p>
<p>there was an athletic feeling about the way he carried his body, as though he was ready to pounce on</p>
<p>a news source. only he /"ust didn t pounce quite fast enough this time. she walked up and gave him</p>
<p>a hug. for a lot of reasons. "hey, we can t go on meeting like this." "my god, how humiliating."</p>
<p>he winced. "what in heaven s name /"ust happened? that was kristen, all right. but why was she running from</p>
<p>you?" "i saw this woman walking very fast up the street carrying a backpack and i just took a shot</p>
<p>and called out kristen, she glanced back at me, then took off like a rabbit. all i accomplished was to</p>
<p>drive her directly into the grasp of those goons." "you scared her," the girl with the pierced eyebrows shouted, gazing</p>
<p>angrily at stone. "who are you? why did you-?" "i m a newspaper reporter," he said. "who are you?" "i</p>
<p>sublet the garden apartment from her. i met her when i was doing her makeup at the e! channel. i</p>
<p>mentioned i was looking for a place and she said she liked me and wanted somebody she liked to be</p>
<p>her subtenant. the rent is really law. then they canceled her show and she had a mental meltdown and went</p>
<p>to a spa somewhere to regroup. or at least that s what everybody at e! says." "so that s definitely</p>
<p>kristen starr?" ally asked. "i hadn t seen her in over five months, not even to pay the rent, and</p>
<p>i couldn t believe it was her when she rang my bell and asked if she could borrow my copy</p>
<p>of her key. at first i almost didn t recognize her. she looked . . . different somehow. the odd</p>
<p>part was, i got the impression that she didn t recognize me either, at least for a minute or two.</p>
<p>when i asked her if she wanted the rent, she just looked at me funny. a few minutes later, she</p>
<p>brought the key back and she had a half-open backpack stuffed with clothes and papers. she seemed nervous and disoriented.</p>
<p>i was going to try and help her get a cab. but then you showed up." "hey, look, i had</p>
<p>no idea i was going to freak her out like that," stone said. "what s your name?" ally asked and</p>
<p>then she introduced herself. "my named is cindy dobbs, and you know something? kristen didn t seem like the same</p>
<p>person, in a lot of ways. she looked really different. i don t know how to explain it. but something</p>
<p>was really, really wrong with her. and she kept saying her name wasn t kristen, that it s something else-i</p>
<p>can t remember what now, all i know is, she was totally spooked." "talk about bad timing," stone said. "she</p>
<p>was so paranoid she kept babbling about how they knew she was here in her apartment and were coming to</p>
<p>get her and she had to get away real quick. i don t know who she was talking about.</p>
