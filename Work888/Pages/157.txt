<p>above this shop "here three floors, evidently apartments. the windows were not lighted. "lauffer lives on the fourth floor," said</p>
<p>miss erith. "will you please give me the jimmy, vaux?" he fished it out of his overcoat pocket and looked</p>
<p>uneasily up and down the deserted avenue while the girl stepped calmly into the open entryway. there were two doors,</p>
<p>a glass one opening on the stairs leading to the upper floors, and the shop door on the left. she</p>
<p>stooped over for a rapid survey, then with incredible swiftness jimmied the shop door. the noise of the illegal operations</p>
<p>awoke the icy and silent avenue with a loud, splitting crash! the door swung gently inward. "quick!" she said. and</p>
<p>he followed her guiltily inside. the shop was quite warm. a stove in the rear room still emitted heat and</p>
<p>a dull red light. on the stove was a pot of glue, or some other substance used by gilders and</p>
<p>frame makers. steam curled languidly from it," also a smell not quite as languid. vaux handed her an electric torch,</p>
<p>then flashed his own. the next moment she found a push button and switched on the lights in the shop.</p>
<p>then they extinguished their torches. stacks of frames in raw Wood, frames in "compo," samples gilded and in natural finish</p>
<p>littered the untidy place. a few process "mezzotints" hung on the walls. there was a counter on which lay twine,</p>
<p>shears and wrapping paper, and a copy of the most recent telephone directory. it was the only book in sight,</p>
<p>and miss erith opened it and spread her copy of the cipher-letter beside it. then she began to turn the</p>
<p>pages according to the numbers written in her copy of the cipher letter. meanwhile, vaux was prowling. there were no</p>
<p>books in the rear room; of this he was presently assured. he came back into the front shop and began</p>
<p>to rummage. a few trade catalogues rewarded him and he solemnly laid them on the counter. "the telephone directory is</p>
<p>not the key," said miss erith, pushing it aside. a few moments were sufficient to convince them that the key</p>
<p>did not lie within any of the trade catalogues either. "have you searched very carefully?" she asked. "there s not</p>
<p>another book in the bally shop." "well, then, lauffer must have it in his apartment upstairs." "which apartment is it?"</p>
<p>"the fourth floor. his name is under a bell on a brass plate in the entry. i noticed it when</p>
<p>i came in." she turned off the electric light; they Went to the door, reconnoitred cautiously, saw nobody on the</p>
<p>avenue. however, a tramcar was passing, and they waited; then vaux flashed his torch on the bell-plate. under the bell</p>
<p>marked "fourth floor" was engraved herman lauffer s name. "you know," remonstrated vaux, "we have no warrant for this sort</p>
<p>of thing, and it means serious trouble if we re caught." "i know it. but what other way is there?"</p>
<p>she inquired naively. "you allowed me only twenty-four hours, and i won t back out!" "what procedure do you propose</p>
<p>now?" he asked, grimly amused, and beginning to feel rather reckless himself, and enjoying the feeling. "what do you wish</p>
<p>to do?" he repeated. "i m game." "i have an automatic pistol," she remarked seriously, tapping her fur-coat pocket, "--and</p>
<p>a pair of handcuffs--the sort that open and lock when you strike a man on the wrist with them. you</p>
<p>know the kind?" "surely. you mean to commit assault and robbery in the first degree upon the body of the</p>
<p>aforesaid herman?" "i-is that it?" she faltered. "it is." she hesitated: "that is rather dreadful, isn t it?" "somewhat. it</p>
<p>involves almost anything short of life imprisonment. but i don t mind." "we couldn t get a search-warrant, could we?"</p>
<p>"we have found nothing, so far, in that cipher letter to encourage us in applying for any such warrant," he</p>
<p>said cruelly. "wouldn t the excuse that lauffer is an enemy alien and not registered aid us in securing a</p>
<p>warrant?" she insisted. "he is not an alien. i investigated that after you left this afternoon. his parents were german</p>
<p>but he was born in chicago. however, he is a hun, all right--i don t doubt that.... what do you</p>
<p>propose to do now?" she looked at him appealingly: "won t you allow me more than twenty-four hours?" "i m</p>
<p>sorry." "why won t you?" "because i can t dawdle over this affair." the girl smiled at him in her</p>
<p>attractive, resolute way: "unless we find that book we can t decipher this letter. the letter comes from mexico,--from that</p>
<p>german-infested republic. it is written to a man of german parentage and it is written in cipher. the names of</p>
<p>luxburg, caillaux, bolo, bernstorff are still fresh in our minds. every day brings us word of some new attempt at</p>
<p>sabotage in the united states. isn t there any way, mr. vaux, for us to secure the key to this</p>
<p>cipher letter?" "not unless we go up and knock this man lauffer on the head. do you want to try</p>
<p>it?" "couldn t we knock rather gently on his head?" vaux stifled a laugh. the girl was so pretty, the</p>
<p>risk so tremendous, the entire proceeding so utterly outrageous that a delightful sense of exhilaration possessed him. "where s that</p>
<p>gun?" he said. she drew it out and handed it to him. "is it loaded?" "yes." "where are the handcuffs?"</p>
<p>she fished out the nickel-plated bracelets and he pocketed his torch. a pleasant thrill passed through the rather ethereal anatomy</p>
<p>of mr. vaux. "all right," he said briskly. "here s hoping for ad/loining cells!" to jimmy the glass door was</p>
<p>the swiftly cautious work of a moment or two. then the dark stairs rose in front of them and vaux</p>
<p>took the lead. it was as cold as the pole in there, but vaux s blood was racing now. and</p>
<p>alas! the photograph of arethusa was in his desk at the office." on the third floor he flashed his</p>
