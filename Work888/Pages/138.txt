<p>of the world an inclination to return to unity. creation reaches its zenith in human beings. the fire of love</p>
<p>is proportionate to the perfection of its ob/"ect, couples gain a taste for divine mercy on the physical and spiritual</p>
<p>levels. this puts them on a iourney towards allah through the means of divine attraction and love. in this way,</p>
<p>the wisdom behind creation prevails on their minds in the final analysis, layla is an ordinary human being, she has</p>
<p>made her lover into a legend such that even his original name, which was qays, has been changed to ma/"nun,</p>
<p>which means crazy. but what happens to the lover if the beloved is not layla but the one who was</p>
<p>referred to allah as my beloved. tie the prophet sallallahu alaihi wa sallam}? let us explain this issue more clearly</p>
<p>with a few examples. the first one is from the life of rumi: ghuriu khatun was a female disciple of</p>
<p>rumi. her husband was a general. one day, he was assigned to work in kayseri, a city in anatolia. ghuriu</p>
<p>khatun wanted to carry a picture of her master, rumi, with her as they prepared to leave konya. she asked</p>
<p>the famous painter and decorator of the saliuqi palace to secretly make a picture of rumi and bring it to</p>
<p>her, the painter went to rumi and asked for his permission. rumi smiled at the painter and gave him permission:</p>
<p>-do as you have been requested, the way you like. the painter began drawing. yet as he completed the painting,</p>
<p>he realized that the person in front of him, turned into another form that bore no resemblance to his painting.</p>
<p>so he drew him again and again. this continued twenty times. in the end, the painter realized his powerlessness and</p>
<p>gave up. he kissed the hands of rumi. his art was lost in his drawing. this event caused an awakening</p>
<p>in the painter, throwing him into deep thought, amazement, fear, and awe. the following words came forth from the tongue</p>
<p>of this astonished painter: -in this religion, if a saint engenders this, what would its prophet be like." imam malik,</p>
<p>may allah be pleased with him, lived in the ecstasy of union with prophet muhammad sallallahu alaihi wa sallam. he</p>
<p>did not mount an animal in the city of madina. he did not use the toilet. he always spoke with</p>
<p>a low voice while in the mosque Of prophet muhammad sallallahu alaihi wa sallam. when the Caliph of the time</p>
<p>spoke loudly in the mosque of the prophet, sallallahu alaihi wa sallam, he reminded him as follows: -o caliph! keep</p>
<p>your voice low in this place. this warning came from allah to a group of people more virtuous than you.</p>
<p>then he read the following verse from the qur an: "o ye who believe! lift not up your voices above</p>
<p>the voice of the prophet, nor shout when speaking to him as ye shout at one another, lest your works</p>
<p>be rendered vain while ye likewise, imam malik forgave the governor of madina who had mistreated him by saying: "on</p>
<p>the day of iudgment, i would feel ashamed to be at court with a grandson of the prophet sallallahu alaihi</p>
<p>Wa sallam." the great teacher as ad arbili articulated his love for prophet muhammad, sallallahu alaihi wa sallam, in a</p>
<p>beautiful manner too: it is impossible to wash the corpse of the martyr of love with all this fire; the</p>
<p>body is fire; the shroud is fire: even the sweet water is fire! the azari poet, fuzuli, explained love as</p>
<p>follows in his famous "ode of water": do not shed tears, o my eye, onto the flames of my heart,</p>
<p>for, water cannot extinguish such a glowing fire. ottoman sultan ahmad khan i aimed to gain spiritual blessing by making</p>
<p>a small model of the prophet s sandal and putting it on his turban. he wrote: i wish i could</p>
<p>always carry on my head as a crown, the pure foot of the king of the prophets. the emperor of</p>
<p>the world in his time, yavuz sultan selim khan, believed that the value of a friend of allah, who could</p>
<p>lead one to prophet muhammad sallallahu alaihi wa sallam, was above all else and expressed this feeling in a couplet:</p>
<p>becoming the king of this world is but a useless struggle, being the slave of a saint is superior to</p>
<p>all else. this is an expression of the importance of spiritually growing closer to prophet muhammad sallallahu alaihi wa sallam,</p>
<p>and to his lovers. likewise, rumi said, "love moves the muddy waters to clarity. true love gives life to dead</p>
<p>hearts; it even makes the sultans slaves." sayyid ahmad yasawi, who dug a grave for himself when he reached the</p>
<p>age of sixty-three and began living in it, said: "beyond this age, it would not be appropriate for me to</p>
<p>reside above the ground." since the prophet muhammad sallallahu alaihi wa sallam, had passed away at the age of sixty-three,</p>
<p>the hero of love, who was completely united with his beloved, chose to leave this world at the same age</p>
<p>by continuing to pass his life in a grave. because of his legendary love for prophet muhammad sallallahu alaihi wa</p>
<p>sallam, the land ahmad yasawi lived in is called blessed turkistan. in a similar manner, when uways al-qarani learned that</p>
<p>one of the teeth of the prophet sallahu alaihi wa sallam, had been broken in the battle of uhud, all</p>
<p>his teeth felt alien to him. as he did not know which one had been broken, he took out all</p>
<p>of them in order to maintain his unity with the beloved. the husband, father and brother of a woman from</p>
<p>a tribe called the sons of dinar became martyrs in the battle of uhud. when she was informed that all</p>
<p>three had died, she requested: when they showed her the prophet, sallallahu alaihi wa sallam, she felt contentment and said:</p>
<p>-o messenger of allah! as long as you are alive, all other afflictions are nothing for me. when hansa</p>
