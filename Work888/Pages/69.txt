<p>took his bearings. a lamp burned in the kitchen, showing a dirty brick floor and a littered table - such</p>
<p>a house as men keep, untidy and unhomelike. a burnt kettle stood on the hearth, and leaning against the wall</p>
<p>was the bag of grain maurice had carried from the crossroads. "a mill which grinds without grain," henri said to</p>
<p>himself. there was a boxed-in staircase to the upper floor, and there, with the door slightly ajar, he stationed himself,</p>
<p>pistol in hand. now and then he glanced uneasily at the clock. sara lee must not be back before he</p>
<p>had taken his prisoners to the little house and turned them over to those who waited there. there were footsteps</p>
<p>outside, and henri drew the door a little closer. but he was dismayed to find it marie. she crept in,</p>
<p>a white and broken thing, and looked about her. "maurice!" she called. she sat down for a moment, and then,</p>
<p>seeing the disorder about her, set to work to clear the table. it was then that henri lowered his pistol</p>
<p>and opened the door. "don t shriek, marie," he said. she turned and saw him, and clutched at the table.</p>
<p>"monsieur!" "marie," he said quietly, "go up these stairs and remain quiet. do not walk round. and do not come</p>
<p>down, no matter what you hear!" she obeyed him, stumbling somewhat. for she had seen his revolver, and it frightened</p>
<p>her. but as she passed him she clutched at his sleeve. "he is good - maurice," she said, gasping. "of</p>
<p>the father i know nothing, but maurice -" "go up and be silent!" was all he said. now, by all</p>
<p>that goes to make a story, sara lee should have met mabel at the hotel des arcades in dunkirk, and</p>
<p>should have been able to make that efficient young woman burn with iealousy - mabel, who from the safety of</p>
<p>her hospital in boulogne considered dunkirk the front. indeed sara lee, to whom the world was beginning to seem very</p>
<p>small, had had some such faint hope. but mabel was not there, and it was not until long after that</p>
<p>they met at all, and then only when the lights had gone down and sara lee was again knitting by</p>
<p>the fire. there were a few nurses there, in their white veils with the red cross over the forehead, and</p>
<p>one or two englishwomen in hats that sat a trifle too high on the tops of their heads and with</p>
<p>long lists before them which they checked as they ate. aviators in leather coats," a few spahis in cloak and</p>
<p>turban, with full-gathered bloomers and high boots; some american amhulance drivers, rather noisy and very young; and many officers, in</p>
<p>every uniform of the allied armies - sat at food together and for a time forgot their anxieties under the</p>
<p>influence of lights, food and warmth, and red and white wine mixed with water. when he chose, jean could be</p>
<p>a delightful companion; not with henri s lift of spirits, but quietly interesting. and that evening he was a new</p>
<p>lean to sara lee, a man of the world, talking of world affairs. he found her apt and intelligent, and</p>
<p>for sara lee much that had been clouded cleared up forever that night. until then she had known only the</p>
<p>humanities of the war, or its inhumanities. there, over that little table, she learned something of its politics and its</p>
<p>inevitability. she had been working in the dark, with her heart only. now she began to grasp the real significance</p>
<p>of it all, of belgium s anxiety for many years, of germany s cold and cruel preparation, and empty protests</p>
<p>of friendship. she learned of the flight of the government from brussels, the most important state papers being taken away</p>
<p>in a hand cart, on top of which, at the last moment, some flustered official had placed a tall silk</p>
<p>hat! she learned of the failure of great fortifications before the invaders heavy guns. and she had drawn for her</p>
<p>such a picture of albert of belgium as she was never to forget. perhaps sara lee s real growth began</p>
<p>that night, over that simple diuner at the hotel des arcades. "i wish," she said at last, "that uncle iames</p>
<p>could have heard all this. he was always so puzzled about it all. and - you make it so clear."</p>
<p>when dinner was over a bit of tension had relaxed in her somewhat. she had been too close, for too</p>
<p>long. and when a group of belgian omcers, learning who she was, asked to be presented and gravely thanked her,</p>
<p>she flushed with happiness. "we must see if mademoiselle shall not have a medal," said the only one who spoke</p>
<p>english. "a medal? for what?" "for courage," he said, bowing. "belgium has little to give, but it can at least</p>
<p>do honor to a brave lady." /ean was smiling when they passed on. what a story would this slip of</p>
<p>a girl take home with her! but: "i don t think i want a medal, /"ean," ;he said. "i didn</p>
<p>t come for that. and after all it is you and henri who have done the thing - not i."</p>
<p>accustomed to women of a more sophisticated class, lean had at first taken her naivete for the height of subtlety.</p>
<p>he was always expecting her to betray herself. but after that evening with her he changed. /"ust such simplicity had</p>
<p>been his wife s. sometimes sara lee reminded him of her - the upraising of her eyes or an unstudied</p>
<p>gesture. he sighed. "you are very wonderful, you americans," he said. it was the nearest to a compliment that he</p>
<p>had ever come. and after that evening he was always very gentle with her. once he had protected her because</p>
<p>henri had asked him to do so." now he himself became in his silent way her protector. the ride home</p>
<p>through the dark was very quiet. sara lee sat beside him watching the stars and growing increasingly anxious as</p>
