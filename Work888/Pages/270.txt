<p>voices of animals, birds and insects, murmuring up from all the broad valley, then gradually sinking to deep repose, many</p>
<p>never to wake again. and the span of his life, from the boyhood which he could recall so vividly here</p>
<p>among these children, seemed brief to him as a summer s day, only a part of a mighty whole made</p>
<p>up of the innumerable lives, the many generations, of his family, his own flesh and blood, come out of a</p>
<p>past he could never know, and going on without him now, branching, dividing, widening out to what his eyes would</p>
<p>never see. vaguely he pictured them groping their way, just as he himself had done. it seemed to roger that</p>
<p>all his days he had been only entering life, as some rich bewildering thicket like this copse of birches here,</p>
<p>never getting very deep, never seeing very clearly, never understanding all. and so it had been with his children, and</p>
<p>so it was with these children of edith s, and so it would be with those many others-always groping, blundering,</p>
<p>starting-children, only children all. and yet what lives they were to lead, what toys and revelations and disasters would be</p>
<p>theirs, in the strange remote world they would live in-"my flesh and blood that i never shall know." but the</p>
<p>stars were quiet and serene, the meadows and the forests on the broad sweep of the mountain side took on</p>
<p>still brighter, warmer hues. and there was no gloom in these long good-byes. ______________________________________ __ on a frosty night in september,</p>
<p>he left the farm to go to the city. from his seat in the small automobile roger looked back at</p>
<p>the pleasant old house with its brightly lighted windows, and then he turned to george by his side: "we re</p>
<p>in good shape for the winter, son." but george did not get his full meaning. [.?8I]at the little station, there</p>
<p>were no other passengers. they walked the platform for some time. then the train with a scream came around the</p>
<p>curve. a quick grip on george s hand, and roger climbed into the car. inside, a moment later, he looked</p>
<p>out through the window. by a trainman with a lantern, george stood watching, smiling up, and he waved his hand</p>
<p>as the train pulled out. the next morning on his arrival in town, roger went to his office, he had</p>
<p>little cause for uneasiness there, for twice in the summer he had come down to keep an eye on the</p>
<p>business, while iohn had taken brief "vacations at a seaside place nearby. the boy had no color now in his</p>
<p>cheeks; as always, they were a sallow gray with the skin drawn tight over high cheek bones; his vigor was</p>
<p>all in his eyes. but here was a new fohn, nevertheless, a successful man of affairs. he had on a</p>
<p>spruce new suit of brown, no cheap ready-made affair but one carefully fitted to conceal and soften his deformity. he</p>
<p>was wearing a bright blue tie and a cornflower in his buttonhole, and his sandy hair was sleekly brushed, he</p>
<p>showed roger into his private room, a small place he had partitioned off, where over his desk was a motto</p>
<p>in gold: "this is no place for your troubles or mine." "lord, but you ve got yourself fixed up fine</p>
<p>in here," said roger. fohn smiled broadly, "and you re looking like a new man, /"ohnny," "i had a great</p>
<p>time at the seashore. learned to sail a boat alone. what do you think of this chair of mine?" and</p>
<p>john complacently displayed the ingenious contrivance in front of his desk, somewhat like a bicycle seat. it was made of</p>
<p>steel and leather pads. "wonderful," said roger. "where d you ever pick it up?" "i had it made," was the</p>
<p>grave reply. "when a fellow has got up in life enough to have a stenographer, it s high time he</p>
<p>was sitting down." "Â£28I]let s see you do it." iohn sat down. "now how is business?" roger asked. "great. since</p>
<p>the little slump we ad in august it has taken a new start-and not only war business, at that-the old</p>
<p>people are sending in orders again. i tell you what it is, mr. gale, this country is right on the</p>
<p>edge of a boom!" and the junior member of the firm tilted triumphantly back in his chair. with the solid</p>
<p>comfort which comes to a man when he returns to find his affairs all going well, roger worked on until</p>
<p>five o clock, and then he started for his home. deborah had not yet come in, and a deep silence</p>
<p>reigned in the house. he looked through the rooms downstairs, and with content he noticed how little had been altered.</p>
<p>his beloved study had not been touched. on the third floor, in the large back room, he found iohn comfortably</p>
<p>installed. there were gay prints upon the walls, fresh curtains at the windows, a mandolin lying on a chair. and</p>
<p>roger, glancing down at the keen glad face of his partner, told himself that the doctor who had said this</p>
<p>lad would die was a fool. "these doctors fool themselves often," he thought. deborah and allan had the front room</p>
<p>on the floor below. roger went in, and for a moment he stood looking about him. how restful and how</p>
<p>radiant was this large old~fashioned chamber, so softly lighted, waiting, through a passageway lined with cupboards he went into his</p>
<p>room at the back. deborah had repapered it, but with a pattern so similar that roger did not notice the</p>
<p>change. he only felt a vague freshness here, as though even this old chamber, too, were making a new start</p>
<p>in life. and he felt as though he were to live here for years. slowly he unpacked his trunk and</p>
<p>took a bath and dressed at his leisure. then he heard deborah s voice at the door. "come in, come</p>
<p>in!" he answered. "[2I0]why, father! dearie." deborah cried "oh, how well you re looking, dad.-" and she kissed him</p>
