<p>a supplementary repast. michel, utterly done up, did not answer. nicholl then tried to prepare some tea destined to help</p>
<p>the absorption of a dozen sandwiches. he first tried to get some fire, and struck a match sharply, what was</p>
<p>his surprise to see the sulphur shine with so extraordinary a brilliancy as to be almost unbearable to the eye.</p>
<p>from the gas-burner which he lit rose a flame equal to a /"et of electric light. a revelation dawned on</p>
<p>nicholl s mind. that intensity of light, the physiological troubles which had arisen in him, the overexcitement of all his</p>
<p>moral and quarrelsome faculties-- he understood all. "the oxygen!" he exclaimed. and leaning over the air apparatus, he saw that</p>
<p>the tap was allowing the colorless gas to escape freely, life-giving, but in its pure state producing the gravest disorders</p>
<p>in the system, michel had blunderingly opened the tap of the apparatus to the full. nicholl hastened to stop the</p>
<p>escape of oxygen with which the atmosphere was saturated, which would have been the death of the travelers, not by</p>
<p>suffocation, but by combustion. an hour later, the air less charged with it restored the lungs to their normal condition.</p>
<p>by degrees the three friends recovered from their intoxication; but they Were obliged to sleep themselves sober over their oxygen</p>
<p>as a drunkard does over his wine. when michel learned his share of the responsibility of this incident, he was</p>
<p>not much disconcerted. this unexpected drunkenness broke the monotony of the journey. many foolish things had been sald while under</p>
<p>its influence, but also quickly forgotten. "and then," added the merry frenchman, "i am not sorry to have tasted a</p>
<p>little of this heady gas. do you know, my friends, that a curious establishment might be founded with rooms of</p>
<p>oxygen, where people whose system is weakened could for a few hours live a more active life. fancy parties where</p>
<p>the room was saturated with this heroic fluid, theaters where it should be kept at high pressure; what passion in</p>
<p>the souls of the actors and spectators! what fire, what enthusiasm! and if, instead of an assembly only a whole</p>
<p>people could be saturated, what activity in its functions, what a supplement to life it would derive. from an exhausted</p>
<p>nation they might make a great and strong one, and i know more than one state in old europe which</p>
<p>ought to put itself under the regime of oxygen for the sake of its health!" michel spoke with so much</p>
<p>animation that one might have fancied that the tap was still too open. but a few words from barbicane soon</p>
<p>shattered his enthusiasm. "that is all very well, friend michel," sald he, "but will you inform us where these chickens</p>
<p>came from which have mixed themselves up in our concert?" "those chickens?" "yes." indeed, half a dozen chickens and a</p>
<p>fine cock were walking about, flapping their wings and chattering. "ah, the awkward things!" exclaimed michel. "the oxygen has made</p>
<p>them revolt." "but what do you want to do with these chickens?" asked barbicane. "to acclimatize them in the moon,</p>
<p>by /"ove!" "then why did you hide them?" "a joke, my worthy president, a simple ioke, which has proved a</p>
<p>miserable failure. i wanted to set them free on the lunar continent, without saying anything. oh, what would have been</p>
<p>your amazement on seeing these earthly-winged animals pecking in your lunar fields!" "you rascal, you unmitigated rascal," replied barbicane, "you</p>
<p>do not want oxygen to mount to the head. you are always what we were under the influence of the</p>
<p>gas; you are always foolish!" "ah, who says that we were not wise then?" replied michel ardan. after this philosophical</p>
<p>reflection, the three friends set about restoring the order of the projectile. chickens and cock were reinstated in their coop.</p>
<p>but while proceeding with this operation, barbicane and his two companions had a most desired perception of a new phenomenon.</p>
<p>from the moment of leaving the earth, their own weight, that of the proiectile, and the objects it enclosed, had</p>
<p>been subject to an increasing diminution. if they could not prove this loss of the projectile, a moment would arrive</p>
<p>when it would be sensibly felt upon themselves and the utensils and instruments they used. it is needless to say</p>
<p>that a scale would not show this loss; for the weight destined to weight the object would have lost exactly</p>
<p>as much as the object itself; but a spring steelyard for example, the tension of which was independent of the</p>
<p>attraction, would have given a just estimate of this loss. we know that the attraction, otherwise called the weight, is</p>
<p>in proportion to the densities of the bodies, and inversely as the squares of the distances. hence this effect: if</p>
<p>the earth had been alone in space, if the other celestial bodies had been suddenly annihilated, the proiectile, according to</p>
<p>newton s laws, would weigh less as it got farther from the earth, but without ever losing its weight entirely,</p>
<p>for the terrestrial attraction would always have made itself felt, at whatever distance. but, in reality, a time must come</p>
<p>when the proiectile would no longer be subject to the law of weight, after allowing for the other celestial bodies</p>
<p>whose effect could not be set down as zero. indeed, the projectile s course was being traced between the earth</p>
<p>and the moon. as it distanced the earth, the terrestrial attraction diminished: but the lunar attraction rose in proportion. there</p>
<p>must come a point where these two attractions would neutralize each other: the proiectile would possess weight no longer. if</p>
<p>the moon s and the earth s densities had been equal, this point would have been at an equal distance</p>
<p>between the two orbs. but taking the different densities into consideration, it was easy to reckon that this point would</p>
<p>be situated at 4I/60th: of the whole iourney, i.e., at I8,514 leagues from the earth. at this point, a body</p>
<p>having no principle of speed or displacement in itself, would remain immovable forever, being attracted equally by both orbs,</p>
