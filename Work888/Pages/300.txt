<p>only the huntsman, the whip, and wat danbury -- all going strong. "but the country got worse and worse and the hills were steeper and more thickly covered</p>
<p>in heather and bracken. the horses were over their hocks all the time, and the place was pitted with rabbit-holes; but the hounds were still streaming along, and</p>
<p>the riders Could not afford to pick their steps. as they raced down one slope, the hounds were always flowing up the opposite one, until it looked like</p>
<p>that game where the one figure in falling makes the other one rise. "but never a glimpse did they get of the fox, although they knew very well</p>
<p>that he must be only a very fhort way ahead for the scent to be so strong. and then wat danbury heard a crash and a thud at</p>
<p>his elbow, and looking round he saw a pair of white cords and top-boots kicking out of a tussock of brambles. the whip s horse had stumbled, and</p>
<p>the whip was out of the running. danbury and the huntsman eased down for an instant; and then, seeing the man staggering to his feet all right, they</p>
<p>turned and settled into their saddles once more. "/"oe clarke, the huntsman, was a famous old rider, known for five counties round; but he reckoned upon his second</p>
<p>horse, and the second horses had all been left many miles behind. however, the one he was riding was good enough for anything with such a horseman upon</p>
<p>his back, and he was going as well as when he started. as to wat danbury, he was going better. with every stride his own feelings improved, and</p>
<p>the mind of the rider had its influence upon the mind of the horse. the stout little roan was gathering its muscular limbs under it, and stretching to</p>
<p>the gallop as if it were steel and whale-bone instead of flesh and blood. wat had never come to the end of its powers yet, and to-day he</p>
<p>had such a chance of testing them as he had never had before. "there was a pasture country beyond the heather slopes, and for several miles the two</p>
<p>riders were either losing ground as they fumbled with their crop-handles at the bars of gates, or gaining it again as they galloped over the fields. those were</p>
<p>the days before this accursed wire came into the country, and you could generally break a hedge where you could not fly it, so they did not trouble</p>
<p>the gates more than they could help. then they were down in a hard lane, where they had to slacken their pace, and through a farm where a</p>
<p>man came shouting excitedly after them," but they had no time to stop and listen to him, for the bounds were on some ploughland, only two fields ahead.</p>
<p>it was sloping upwards, that ploughland, and the horses were over their fetlocks in the red, soft soil. "when they reached the top they were blowing badly, but</p>
<p>a grand valley sloped before them, leading up to the open country of the south downs. between, there lay a belt of pine-woods, into which the hounds were</p>
<p>streaming, running now in a long, straggling line, and shedding one here and one there as they ran. you could see the white-and-tan dots here and there where</p>
<p>the limpers were tailing away. but half the pack were still going well, though the pace and distance had both been tremendous -- two clear hours now without</p>
<p>a check. "there was a drive through the pine-wood -- one of those green, slightly rutted drives where a horse can get the last yard out of itself,</p>
<p>for the ground is hard enough to give him clean going and yet springy enough to help him. wat danbury got alongside of the huntsman and they galloped</p>
<p>together with their stirrup-irons touching, and the hounds within a hundred yards of them. " we have it all to ourselves, said he. " yes, sir, we ve</p>
<p>shook on the lot of em this time, said old ioe clarke. if we get this fox it s worth while aving im skinned an stuffed, for e</p>
<p>s a curiosity e is. " it s the fastest run i ever had in my life! cried danbury. " and the fastest that ever i ad, an</p>
<p>that means more, said the old huntsman. but what licks me is that we ve never ad a look at the beast. e must leave an amazin scent</p>
<p>be ind im when these ounds can follow im like this, and yet none of us have seen im when we ve ad a clear alf mile view</p>
<p>in front of us. " i expect we ll have a view of him presently, said danbury." and in his mind he added, at least, i shall, for</p>
<p>the huntsman s horse was gasping as it ran, and the white foam was pouring down it like the side of a washing-tub. "they had followed the hounds</p>
<p>on to one of the side tracks which led out of the main drive, and that divided into a smaller track still, where the branches switched across</p>
