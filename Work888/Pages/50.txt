<p>lip, roger was pleased with the world and his place in it. he could imagine nowhere he would rather be</p>
<p>than cruising through the desert with his best friends. he pressed his forehead against the window to get a better</p>
<p>look outside and was surprised at how cold the glass was against his skin, but this also was pleasing. in</p>
<p>the desert, it was noticeably dark. night was omnipresent. the view out the window revealed a world of blackness with</p>
<p>no visible horizon. in contrast, by craning his neck upwards, roger could see a sky filled with more stars than</p>
<p>he could hope to comprehend. though it was windy outside, the bmw muted everything from the external environment. the world</p>
<p>appeared perfectly still from inside the car, as if frozen in time. strangely, there were no other vehicles within a</p>
<p>quarter of a mile in either direction. as if to take advantage of the clearing, a tumbleweed nearly the size</p>
<p>of a small car blew across the freeway just two hundred feet in front of the oncoming bmw, but no</p>
<p>one noticed it. roger leaned back and used the back of his hand to wipe away the steam his forehead</p>
<p>had imparted on the window. when he was done, he saw the iconic street sign for zzyzx road fly by.</p>
<p>on their first trips to vegas, this sign was always pointed out as some kind of important landmark. once, on</p>
<p>a previous trip, they exited the freeway here to see what this mysterious road was all about. had they researched</p>
<p>it, they would have learned that the name was coined in 1I44 by curtis howe springer who claimed it to</p>
<p>be the last word in the english language. mr. springer opened a health spa and sold bottled water from nearby</p>
<p>springs to desert travelers, but was eventually arrested for misuse of the land and alleged food and drug violations. as</p>
<p>of 2006, the land surrounding zzyzx was under control of the bureau of land management, who allowed california state university</p>
<p>to manage it and conduct desert studies, but as far as the guys in the bmw knew, there was nothing</p>
<p>of interest on zzyzx road. in fact, the paved portion ended fairly quickly before an unpromising dirt road took its</p>
<p>place. it was all kind of a tease unless you were the type of person who wanted to leave the</p>
<p>conventional route and venture alone into the unknown vastness of the desert. on this night, there was no comment made</p>
<p>about the strangely named street. it too moved into the past. in the summer of 2000, roger worked two iobs.</p>
<p>wednesdays, fridays and saturdays, he bartended at moose mcgillicutty s in pacific beach, and thursdays and sundays he worked as</p>
<p>a valet, parking cars for the chart house in del mar. monday and tuesday were his days off, used primarily</p>
<p>for surfing, golfing, sleeping and going to the indian casinos. between the two /"obs, he was pulling in about $1,400</p>
<p>a week, very little of which was reported to the internal revenue service. he lived with a roommate in a</p>
<p>simple two-bedroom apartment in pacific beach and tended to date the kind of girls who were not expensive to date.</p>
<p>therefore, he had plenty of money for whatever he wanted to do. due to alex s relentless prodding, he even</p>
<p>opened checking and savings accounts at wells fargo and managed to sock away $5,000. roger felt relatively wealthy, but he</p>
<p>noticed his new friend wayne, a fellow parking valet, was really rolling in cash. in the last month, wayne had</p>
<p>taken his girlfriend on vacation to australia, bought a rolex, and bragged of winning three grand on a single straight</p>
<p>bet on a recent padres game. wayne also took roger and one of the other guys to dinner and drinks</p>
<p>at dakota grill downtown and picked up the tab. it was that night, after several cocktails, that roger learned where</p>
<p>the cash was coming from. apparently, the trip to australia was arranged by one of the customers from the chart</p>
<p>house. on the last day of the trip, wayne was instructed to meet a man at the beach who gave</p>
<p>him a stuffed koala bear to take back to san diego. inside the cute and fuzzy bear were five kilograms</p>
<p>of pure cocaine. for taking the return trip with the koala, wayne was paid $15,000 plus his expenses for the</p>
<p>trip, wayne told roger he could arrange for him to take the same trip next month and would cover his</p>
<p>valet shifts. then wayne would go again the following month. he pointed out that his boss in the arrangement preferred</p>
<p>to have a rotation rather than just one person. wayne was very convincing about how easy the whole thing was,</p>
<p>and about how nice the cash was. additionally, he pointed out that roger could probably talk andrea, one of the</p>
<p>bartenders, into taking the trip with him. roger had a crush on andrea all summer but couldn t get past</p>
<p>the simple flirting stage. wayne painted an enticing picture of the two of them enjoying the sydney beaches, which he</p>
<p>assured roger were even more appealing than those in san diego. the whole idea was very tempting. roger told wayne</p>
<p>he would probably do it but wanted a day to think about it. as fortune would have it, roger was</p>
<p>scheduled to play golf the next day with gary. he brought up the idea during the sixth hole of the</p>
<p>torrey pines north course, a downhill par three with an unbeatable view of the pacific. gary, who already had his</p>
<p>ball teed up, suddenly lost interest in golf and the beauty of the surroundings. he stepped away from the tee-box</p>
<p>and offered his opinion. gary." "roger, no funnying way. do not do this under any circumstances." roger: "it sounds pretty</p>
<p>easy." gary: "it doesn t matter. you do not want to be a drug dealer. this could funny up your</p>
<p>whole life. listen to me. do not do it." that was the end of the conversation for the moment.</p>
