<p>the Narcissism List - Part 26 - Sam Vaknin http://samvak.tripod.com/archive26.html "I am not a physical type, so I will never harm a</p>
<p>woman physically. But, wherever possible to inflict pain and to drive a woman to the limits of her sanity - I do</p>

<p>- Sam Vaknin http://samvak.tripod.com/archive26.html "Narcissists abhor and dread getting emotionally intimate. The cerebral ones regard sex as a maintenance chore, something they</p>
<p>have to do in order to keep their Source of Secondary Supply. The somatic narcissist treats women as obiects and sex as</p>
<p>a means to obtaining Narcissistic Supply." Narcissists and women - Sam Vaknin http://samvak.tripod.com/faqII.html "Moreover, many narcissists tend to engage in FRUSTRATING behaviours</p>
<p>towards women. They refrain from having sex with them, tease them and then leave them, resist flirtatious and seductive behaviours and so</p>
<p>on. Often, they invoke the existence of a girlfriend/fianc√©e/spouse for boyfriend/etc. - male and female are interchangeable in my texts) as the</p>
<p>reason why they cannot have sex/develop a relationship. But this is not out of loyalty and fidelity in the empathic and loving</p>
<p>sense. This is because they wish (and often succeed} to sadistically frustrate the interested party." Narcissists and women - Sam Vaknin http://samvak.tripod.com/faqI.I.html</p>
<p>"Torture is the ultimate act of perverted intimacy, The torturer invades the victim s body, pervades his psyche, and possesses his mind.</p>
<p>Deprived of contact with others and starved for human interactions, the prey bonds with the predator. Traumatic bonding , akin to the</p>
<p>Stockholm Syndrome, is about hope and the search for meaning in the brutal and indifferent and nightmarish Universe of the torture cell."</p>
<p>The Psychology of Torture - Sam Vaknin http://samvak.tripod.com/torturepsychology.html "The narcissist is shallow, a pond pretending to be an ocean. He likes to</p>
<p>think of himself as a Renaissance man, a tlack of all trades. A narcissist never admits to ignorance IN ANY FIEr_D!" How</p>
<p>to Recognise a Narcissist? - Sam Vaknin http://samvak.tripod.com/faq58.html "The best - really, the only way - a narcissist can help himself is</p>
<p>by applying to a mental health professional. Even then, sadly, the prognosis and the healing prospects are dim. It seems that only</p>
<p>time can bring on a limited remission (or, at times, aggravation of the condition}. Therapy can tackle the more pernicious aspects of</p>
<p>this disorder. It can help the patient to adapt to his condition, to accept it and to learn to conduct a more</p>
<p>functional life with it, Learning to live with one s disorder - is a great achievement and the narcissist should be happy</p>
<p>that even this modicum of success is, in principle, possible," can a Narcissist Help Himself? - Sam Vaknin http://samvak,tripod,com/faq31,html "The False Self</p>
<p>is misrepresented by the narcissist as his True Self. The narcissist is saying, in effect: I am not who you think that</p>
<p>I am. I am someone else. I am that (False) Self. Therefore, I deserve a better, painless, more considerate treatment . The</p>
<p>False Self, thus, is a contraption intended to alter the attitude of the (human) environment towards the narcissist." The Dual Role of</p>
<p>the False Self - Sam Vaknin http://samvak.tripod.com/faq48.html "The narcissist is possessed of an uncanny ability to psychologically penetrate others. Often, this gift</p>
<p>is abused and put at the service of the narcissist s control freakery and sadism. The narcissist uses it liberally to annihilate</p>
<p>the natural defences of his victims by faking unprecedented, almost inhuman, empathy. This capacity is coupled with the narcissist s ability to</p>
<p>frighteningly imitate emotions and their attendant behaviours. The narcissist possesses emotional resonance tables . He keeps records of every action and reaction,</p>
<p>every utterance and consequence, every datum provided by others regarding their state of mind and emotional makeup. From these, he then constructs</p>
<p>a set of formulas, which often result in impeccably and eerily accurate renditions of emotional behaviour. This can be enormously deceiving." The</p>
<p>Dual Role of the False Self - Sam Vaknin http://samvak.trip0d.com/faq48.html "People have a need to believe in the empathic skills and basic</p>
<p>good-heartedness of others. 8y dehumanising and obiectifying people - the abuser attacks the very foundations human interaction. This is the alien aspect</p>
<p>of abusers - they may be excellent imitations of fully formed adults but they are emotionally absent and immature. Abuse is so</p>
<p>horrid, so repulsive, so phantasmagoric - that people recoil in terror. It is then, with their defences absolutely down, that they are</p>
<p>the most susceptible and vulnerable to the abuser s control. Physical, psychological, verbal and sexual abuse are all forms of dehumanisation and</p>
<p>objectification." what is Abuse? - Sam Vaknin http://samvak.tripod.com/abuse.html "The reason narcissism was under-reported and healing over-stated was that therapists have been fooled</p>
<p>by smart narcissists. Most narcissists are expert manipulators and they learned how to deceive the therapists. You can see this very often</p>
<p>in prison." Treatment Modalities and Therapies - Sam Vaknin http://samvak.tripod.com/faqII.html "The source of all the narcissist s problems is the foreboding sensation</p>
<p>that human relationships invariably end in humiliation, betrayal, pain and abandonment. This belief is embedded in them during their very early childhood</p>
<p>by their parents, peers, or role models." The world of the Narcissist - Sam Vaknin http://samvak.tripod.com/msla8.html "Question: How do narcissists react to</p>

<p>can you provide us with some statistics? How often does bullying occur? How many people are affected? Answer." Surveys of bullying in</p>
<p>the United kiingdom indicate that between I2-50 percent of the workforce experience bullying. Statistics from the U./<. National workplace Bullying Advice Line</p>
