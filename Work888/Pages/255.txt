and rapaciously. They are dangerous predators. One does not compromise with a tiger or accommodates a snake." Excerpts from the Archives of
the Narcissism List - Part 26 - Sam Vaknin http://samvak.tripod.com/archive26.html "I am not a physical type, so I will never harm a
woman physically. But, wherever possible to inflict pain and to drive a woman to the limits of her sanity - I do
a good /"ob of it." Excerpts from the Archives of the Narcissism List - Part 26 - Sam Vaknin http://samvak.tripod.com/archive.?6.html "Narcissists are
sadists and inverted narcissists are both rare and the perfect match." Excerpts from the Archives of the Narcissism List - Part 26
- Sam Vaknin http://samvak.tripod.com/archive26.html "Narcissists abhor and dread getting emotionally intimate. The cerebral ones regard sex as a maintenance chore, something they
have to do in order to keep their Source of Secondary Supply. The somatic narcissist treats women as obiects and sex as
a means to obtaining Narcissistic Supply." Narcissists and women - Sam Vaknin http://samvak.tripod.com/faqII.html "Moreover, many narcissists tend to engage in FRUSTRATING behaviours
towards women. They refrain from having sex with them, tease them and then leave them, resist flirtatious and seductive behaviours and so
on. Often, they invoke the existence of a girlfriend/fianc√©e/spouse for boyfriend/etc. - male and female are interchangeable in my texts) as the
reason why they cannot have sex/develop a relationship. But this is not out of loyalty and fidelity in the empathic and loving
sense. This is because they wish (and often succeed} to sadistically frustrate the interested party." Narcissists and women - Sam Vaknin http://samvak.tripod.com/faqI.I.html
"Torture is the ultimate act of perverted intimacy, The torturer invades the victim s body, pervades his psyche, and possesses his mind.
Deprived of contact with others and starved for human interactions, the prey bonds with the predator. Traumatic bonding , akin to the
Stockholm Syndrome, is about hope and the search for meaning in the brutal and indifferent and nightmarish Universe of the torture cell."
The Psychology of Torture - Sam Vaknin http://samvak.tripod.com/torturepsychology.html "The narcissist is shallow, a pond pretending to be an ocean. He likes to
think of himself as a Renaissance man, a tlack of all trades. A narcissist never admits to ignorance IN ANY FIEr_D!" How
to Recognise a Narcissist? - Sam Vaknin http://samvak.tripod.com/faq58.html "The best - really, the only way - a narcissist can help himself is
by applying to a mental health professional. Even then, sadly, the prognosis and the healing prospects are dim. It seems that only
time can bring on a limited remission (or, at times, aggravation of the condition}. Therapy can tackle the more pernicious aspects of
this disorder. It can help the patient to adapt to his condition, to accept it and to learn to conduct a more
functional life with it, Learning to live with one s disorder - is a great achievement and the narcissist should be happy
that even this modicum of success is, in principle, possible," can a Narcissist Help Himself? - Sam Vaknin http://samvak,tripod,com/faq31,html "The False Self
is misrepresented by the narcissist as his True Self. The narcissist is saying, in effect: I am not who you think that
I am. I am someone else. I am that (False) Self. Therefore, I deserve a better, painless, more considerate treatment . The
False Self, thus, is a contraption intended to alter the attitude of the (human) environment towards the narcissist." The Dual Role of
the False Self - Sam Vaknin http://samvak.tripod.com/faq48.html "The narcissist is possessed of an uncanny ability to psychologically penetrate others. Often, this gift
is abused and put at the service of the narcissist s control freakery and sadism. The narcissist uses it liberally to annihilate
the natural defences of his victims by faking unprecedented, almost inhuman, empathy. This capacity is coupled with the narcissist s ability to
frighteningly imitate emotions and their attendant behaviours. The narcissist possesses emotional resonance tables . He keeps records of every action and reaction,
every utterance and consequence, every datum provided by others regarding their state of mind and emotional makeup. From these, he then constructs
a set of formulas, which often result in impeccably and eerily accurate renditions of emotional behaviour. This can be enormously deceiving." The
Dual Role of the False Self - Sam Vaknin http://samvak.trip0d.com/faq48.html "People have a need to believe in the empathic skills and basic
good-heartedness of others. 8y dehumanising and obiectifying people - the abuser attacks the very foundations human interaction. This is the alien aspect
of abusers - they may be excellent imitations of fully formed adults but they are emotionally absent and immature. Abuse is so
horrid, so repulsive, so phantasmagoric - that people recoil in terror. It is then, with their defences absolutely down, that they are
the most susceptible and vulnerable to the abuser s control. Physical, psychological, verbal and sexual abuse are all forms of dehumanisation and
objectification." what is Abuse? - Sam Vaknin http://samvak.tripod.com/abuse.html "The reason narcissism was under-reported and healing over-stated was that therapists have been fooled
by smart narcissists. Most narcissists are expert manipulators and they learned how to deceive the therapists. You can see this very often
in prison." Treatment Modalities and Therapies - Sam Vaknin http://samvak.tripod.com/faqII.html "The source of all the narcissist s problems is the foreboding sensation
that human relationships invariably end in humiliation, betrayal, pain and abandonment. This belief is embedded in them during their very early childhood
by their parents, peers, or role models." The world of the Narcissist - Sam Vaknin http://samvak.tripod.com/msla8.html "Question: How do narcissists react to
being humiliated? Answer: As healthy human beings do - only more so, much more so." Narcissistic Humiliation - Sam Vaknin http://samvak.tripod.com/faq53.html "Question:
can you provide us with some statistics? How often does bullying occur? How many people are affected? Answer." Surveys of bullying in
the United kiingdom indicate that between I2-50 percent of the workforce experience bullying. Statistics from the U./<. National workplace Bullying Advice Line
reveal that around 20 percent of cases are from the education sector, I2 percent are from healthcare, 10 percent are from social
services and around 6 percent from the voluntary, charity, not-for-profit sector. After that, calls come from all sectors both public and private,
with finance, media, police, postal workers and other government employees featuring prominently. Enquiries from outside the United icingdom - notably the United
States, Canada, Australia and "/reland - show similar patterns with the caring professions topping the list of bullied workers." Bully at work
