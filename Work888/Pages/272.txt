<p>when he returned to agra, telling me i must dance for him only." her voice hardened. "but i never danced</p>
<p>for him, not once. and three years later he was killed in a campaign in bengal. since that time i</p>
<p>have had to live by my own hand. for many years now i ve lived by teaching dance to the</p>
<p>tavaifs in agra." "tavaifs. muslim dancing girls. courtesans who live in beautiful houses here and entertain men. there are many</p>
<p>in agra and in the city of lucknow to the east." kamala s tone grew vague. "and i teach them</p>
<p>other things as well." "but why did you insult the moghul tonight? do you really believe all the things you</p>
<p>said?" "what i said was not a belief. i don t understand what you mean by that. things either are</p>
<p>or they are not. what does it matter whether we believe them? but what i did was foolish, i agree.</p>
<p>impulsive. i so despise the moghuls. you know, i told the moghul s prime minister this afternoon i would never</p>
<p>dance for arangbar, that nothing could make me, but he forced me to come anyway." hawksworth s eyes narrowed, and</p>
<p>he dropped the shank of lamb he was holding, "what did you say! nadir sharif knew all along you would</p>
<p>refuse to dance for arangbar?" "of course he knew. and i knew arangbar would order me killed. that 5 why</p>
<p>i wore all my diamonds. i thought if i was to die, it must be my dharma." she paused. "and</p>
<p>you know, it s strange but i felt nothing. except perhaps pity for my pretty little courtesans. some of them</p>
<p>are only girls, and i wondered who would teach them after i was gone." hawksworth was no longer listening. he</p>
<p>was trying to remember the exact sequence of what had happened in the diwan-i-khas. he arranged it, the bastard. even</p>
<p>the paintings. nadir sharif played with me like a puppet. just so he could send her here. he knew i</p>
<p>d try to save her. but why would he do it, and in such a way i was never supposed</p>
<p>to know." is this so--called dancer supposed to be another of his spies." "you said you worshipped a god named</p>
<p>shiva. i thought hindus worshiped krishna." kamala looked at him with surprise. "you know of krishna? yes, he is the</p>
<p>god worshiped by the raiputs of the north. but he is a young god. lord shiva is the ancient god</p>
<p>of south india. he presides over the generation of life. his lingam symbolizes the male half of the force that</p>
<p>created the universe." "and i suppose you re about to tell me that s the part of him you worship."</p>
<p>hawksworth kept a straight face. "he is revered in many aspects, including natara/", the god of the dance. but yes,</p>
<p>his lingam is worshiped. have you seen the round stone pillars wreathed in garlands of flowers?" "as a matter of</p>
<p>fact . . ." hawksworth paused, then looked at her sharply. "there was something of that sort in the porters</p>
<p>lodge of the customs house at surat, where my men and i were kept the morning we arrived." "those pillars</p>
<p>symbolize shiva s lingam. let me tell you about it. once, back in the time of the gods, lord shiva</p>
<p>was burdened with unhappiness. he was bereaved of his consort and weary with his being, and he wandered into a</p>
<p>forest, where there were sages and their wives. but the sages scorned lord shiva, because he was haggard, and they</p>
<p>forsook him in his time of sadness, so he had to make his way through the forest begging alms. however,</p>
<p>the women of these sages felt love for him, and they left the beds of their men and followed him.</p>
<p>when the sages saw their wives leaving to follow shiva, they set a curse on him. their curse was that</p>
<p>his lingam would fall to the ground. then one day shiva did shed his lingam. and he was gone. only</p>
<p>his lingam remained, emerging upright from the earth. it had become stone, and it was of infinite length. all the</p>
<p>other gods came to worship it, and told mankind to do likewise. they said that if it was worshiped, shiva</p>
<p>s consort, the goddess parvati, would come to receive the lingam in her yoni, and the earth would be made</p>
<p>fertile. and even now we worship the stone lingam, set erect with a stone yoni as its base. we honor</p>
<p>them with flowers and fire and incense. shiva and parvati are a symbol of the creation of life." she looked</p>
<p>at him, puzzling. "don t christians have such a symbol?" "not quite like that one." hawksworth suppressed a grin. "i</p>
<p>guess the main symbol for christians is the cross," "what do you mean?" "christians believe the son of the christian</p>
<p>god came down to earth and sacrificed himself on a cross. so the cross became a symbol for that act."</p>
<p>"yes, i ve seen that symbol. iesuits wear them, covered with iewels. but i never knew its meaning." kamala paused,</p>
<p>seeming to ponder the idea. "somehow though it seems very static. surely there are other symbols the christians have, symbols</p>
<p>more dynamic and powerful." "i suppose christians think it s pretty powerful," "but don t christians have any symbols like</p>
<p>our bronze statues of the dancing shiva? lord shiva, in his aspect as natarai, the god of the dance, embodies</p>
<p>everything in the world." "that s what you said to arangbar." hawksworth examined her and tried to clear his mind</p>
<p>of the wine. "but i don t understand why you think symbols are so important, whatever their meaning." "symbols are</p>
<p>a visible sign of things we know but can t actually see, like an idea." kamala s voice was soft</p>
<p>and warm. "all right. but it s hard to imagine how one symbol could contain everything, no matter what it</p>
<p>is," "but the dancing shiva does, my handsome feringhi. perhaps you have not seen it. it came out of</p>
