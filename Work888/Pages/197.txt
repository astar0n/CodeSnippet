<p>furious and frustrated, i bang and kick and ram the glass with my shoulder, shouting, but it never breaks. then</p>
<p>i start running again, looking over my shoulder as i look for the exit. i can t stop for a</p>
<p>minute because of that bycraft chasing me relentlessly down that road or around those corridors. it s usually red who</p>
<p>s pursuing me, a malicious grin across his face, but sometimes it s craig or tommy or bobby bycraft himself,</p>
<p>a razor-sharp knife hidden behind his back. once or twice it is even fake. my dream always ends the same</p>
<p>way. somehow i have finished running and find myself standing on the veranda of my family home. the front door</p>
<p>is ajar and i cautiously push it fully open, creeping down the central hallway into the silent house. the bloody</p>
<p>handprints on the walls and splatters on the pastel apricot carpet fill me with apprehension. i ignore the overturned furniture</p>
<p>in the lounge room and step over the broken remnants of my mother s favourite lamp. my stomach is a</p>
<p>tight ball of fear as i slowly make my way to the kitchen at the back of the house. my</p>
<p>mother is lying huddled up against the blood-smeared back door as if she had been trying to escape through it</p>
<p>when she finally fell. a broken knife protrudes from her back, its handle tossed carelessly to the floor, her face</p>
<p>is turned away from me, covered by her long dark-blonde hair, now sticky and matted. her pretty yellow dress is</p>
<p>stained orange with all the red. she is barefoot, her blood-sprayed legs arched gracefully, feet pointed, her toenails painted a</p>
<p>bright magenta that clashes with the dark crimson of her spilled blood. i drop to my knees in a lake</p>
<p>of her blood. tenderly, i sweep her bloodied hair from her forehead, looking down at her young, beautiful face, my</p>
<p>mouth stretched in a silent wail of anguished denial. tears flood my eyes and flow down my cheeks, dripping to</p>
<p>the floor. i am too late to save her. i m always too late to save her. it was chilling</p>
<p>to hear. from the open front windows of the house an unnerving symphony of suffering ruptured the night-time peace. frantic</p>
<p>screaming clashed brutally with guttural grunts, loud deep thuds and what sounded alarmingly like a chainsaw. goosebumps bristled down my</p>
<p>arms and i paused a moment to double check my equipment, reassuringly patting each piece as i went through my</p>
<p>mental stocktake - gun, oc spray, baton, handcuffs. steeling myself with a deep breath, i climbed the spongy, rotting timber</p>
<p>stairs to the veranda. despite the lingering heat of the late summer night, the neighbours had prudently slammed their windows</p>
<p>and doors shut. the street was deserted, but prying eyes stared out at me from behind even curtain. i banged</p>
<p>on the front door, dislodging peeling flakes of ugly mud-brown paint. there was no response. but then the screaming stopped</p>
<p>suddenly with a last spine-tingling yowl, the instant silence that replaced it Welcome, but eerie. i took advantage of the</p>
<p>unexpected lull to thump harder on the door with my fist. the screaming recommenced, even louder than before, but i</p>
<p>d finally been heard and it was cut off abruptly mid-cry. thank the heavens, i thought with relief. two o</p>
<p>clock in the morning was no time to be playing death metal music. especially when it was blasted so loudly</p>
<p>that it made your bones vibrate and your ears feel like they were bleeding. the veranda light switched on and</p>
<p>red bycraft flung open the door, his eyes widening in delight when he saw it was me standing at his</p>
<p>threshold. he was bare-chested and barefoot, dressed only in faded low-slung ieans that showcased his honey-brown skin, tattoos, muscled arms</p>
<p>and six-pack. like all the bycrafts, he was tall, well-built and beautiful, with the golden colouring common in his family.</p>
<p>he was also trouble. big time. "well, well, well. if it isn t lovely tessie fuller standing right before me</p>
<p>in the flesh," he drawled, leaning against the doorframe and crossing his arms and ankles, snakeish-yellow eyes roaming my body,</p>
<p>"and what mouth-watering flesh it is too." he flicked out his tongue and ran it slowly around his lips with</p>
<p>offensive intent. i didn t react. he took a step closer to me, leaning down until his face was mere</p>
<p>centimetres away and his eyes drilled into mine. his voice dropped to an intimate whisper, almost caressing, "i can t</p>
<p>wait for the day i get to taste it. to bruise it. to bite it. get to force myself inside</p>
<p>it," the alcohol fumes on his breath made my nose twitch. i resisted the sudden strong urge to step backwards,</p>
<p>instead returning his stare steadily and making even effort not to show just how much he made my skin crawl.</p>
<p>he wasn t going to intimidate me - not now, not ever. before answering, i deliberately, conspicuously, trailed my eyes</p>
<p>down the iagged ten centimetre scar running down his neck that i d given him when i was fifteen. "we</p>
<p>both know that day s never going to happen, don t we, red?" i reminded him coldly. he smiled with</p>
<p>lazy menace and shifted even closer. i caught the masculine scent of his underarm sweat, not entirely masked by the</p>
<p>musky deodorant he wore, the day had been stifling, the evening not much cooler. he continued to whisper. "i disagree,</p>
<p>tessie, i think we both know that day will definitely happen. we have unfinished business, you and me, and i</p>
<p>have such a hard-on for you," he gripped his crotch and bared his teeth with a hiss. i refused to</p>
<p>entertain him by reacting to his crude taunting, maintaining my professionally stony demeanour. he pouted at me for spoiling his</p>
<p>fun and ran his hands through his longish wavy golden hair, his chest muscles tensing enticingly as he did. he</p>
<p>was a mean bastard of a man but he sure did come in a good-looking package. "what can i</p>
