<p>bar monday about noon. then after lunch i ll get you checked in. leo needs his combat photos taken before</p>
<p>he can fly a combat mission and have his flight status records checked. since you have flown combat missions on</p>
<p>yt before rick you re all set. you planning on showing him around on sunday?" "yes, mother, kim and i</p>
<p>will meet him whenever he decides to get moving tomorrow morning. so don t get him drunk or keep him</p>
<p>out all night. and don t let cheryl flirt with him." "my wife doesn t flirt with young airman." bob</p>
<p>stated defensively. "yeah i know. only young sergeants." "your the only one she hits on. besides, she admits that she</p>
<p>loves you." "i know. i think it s great because i love her too and if she wasn t married</p>
<p>to you, i would have an older girlfriend even if she does have two kids." "tell me bob, how did</p>
<p>you get cheryl and the kids here so fast?" "huh." rick looked at his friend in wonder. "you just said</p>
<p>that cheryl is here. right?" "she is. the kids aren t. we gave them away." "what the hell? stop messing</p>
<p>with me." rick demanded as he laughed out loud. "i m not messing with you. it would be at least</p>
<p>two more months before cheryl and the kids could get here on my pcs orders, they would have to wait</p>
<p>for housing. so cheryl and i decided to sell the kids. take the money from the sale, and buy her</p>
<p>a plane ticket to okinawa by way of iapan. get an okinawan rental just like the guys who live with</p>
<p>their girlfriends do. and here she is. took less than a week and she was here and we were shacked</p>
<p>up in this nice little house with red tile roof, an indoor toilet, western style stove, refrigerator, and shower. all</p>
<p>for $55 a month." "so who was so stupid as to buy your monsters? i can t imagine anyone in</p>
<p>their right minds would pay good money for those two girls." "hey sergeant, those kids are your godchildren," "yeah, but</p>
<p>i m an agnostic, so who cares? who was the salter?" "my folks. the problem though is that i m</p>
<p>not sure we can get them back when we get their orders to come to kadena. their grandparents were too</p>
<p>willing to take the beasts. i m scared shitless they ll blackmail us down the road sometime." "i think that</p>
<p>they should. blackmail you that is. you should have suspected something when they were so eager to take them off</p>
<p>your hands and had them submit to a mental evaluation before you gave the beasts to them." "you hate my</p>
<p>kids." "no, i love them almost as much as you do which is reason that i should also have a</p>
<p>mental evaluation." rosko had sat quietly listening until kruse pulled the truck up to the curb in front of the</p>
<p>transit barracks and he was safely on the sidewalk. "does this go on all the time? i mean if it</p>
<p>does, maybe i d be better off on another tanker." he said with a smile. "your kids aren t here,</p>
<p>right bob? in other words it s safe to go to your house?" "honest, leo, it is. just don t</p>
<p>get too close to cheryl." rick quipped before kruse could answer leo, "iesus, rick, stop telling him things like that,</p>
<p>he ll think we re completely perverted okies and really sold our kids and cheryl is a nut case," "well,</p>
<p>i rest my case." rick was out of the truck and taking bags out of the bed of the pickup.</p>
<p>"i ll give you guys a hand and show you to your room. the flightline is quiet right now and</p>
<p>will be for another hour or so." kruse said as he started towards the front door of the barracks carrying</p>
<p>two of their bags. rick showered and shaved. put on the pants and one of the shirts that he had</p>
<p>bought on his last trip to okinawa. in front of the barracks he iumped on the base shuttle bus with</p>
<p>full intentions of walking out gate #2 then down gate 2 street to bc street and the palms club bar.</p>
<p>at the base gate he stayed on the sidewalk, flashed his id at the air police on duty in the</p>
<p>guard shack set in the middle of the gate and kept walking, "hey, gi, you want girlfriend for weekend?" rick</p>
<p>spun back towards the {hard shack. he knew the voice and happily played her game. "sure how much you charge</p>
<p>for the whole weekend?" standing by the {hard shack door, was a lovely asian woman dressed in a bright green,and</p>
<p>brown floral kimono. her hair was up as it should be to match the kimono. but her lovely face that</p>
<p>rick admired was only touched with a bit of subtle red lipstick and a blush of soft pink on her</p>
<p>high cheek bones. an air policeman and okinawan security guard stood next to her laughing. "for you? it s already</p>
<p>almost dinner time Saturday. how about i buy you dinner and pay for bus to nishihara?" kim declared in her</p>
<p>pseudo-bargirl accent. no longer able to stand their separation kim ran across the intervening street in strides restricted by her</p>
<p>tight fitting kimono. she tried to leap into rick s arms and made it when he lifted her by her</p>
<p>hips. between kisses barely decipherable words flowed. "i love you. i missed you, what took so long for you to</p>
<p>get here. hold me. i love you." they stood in the middle of the sidewalk breathing hard, but not moving,</p>
<p>just holding onto each other tightly. "i think we should go." rick said quietly. "my god! you are beautiful. i</p>
<p>have never seen you in a kimono before." "thank you, my love, you are beautiful also, i know you haven</p>
<p>t. i wanted today to be special for us." "how long have you been waiting?" he asked giving her</p>
