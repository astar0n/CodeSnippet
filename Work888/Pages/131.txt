<p>and this was his fetish. when his companion and he had fled to some prearranged retreat--already occupied, no doubt by a confederate--the companion had persuaded him to leave</p>
<p>so compromising an article of furniture. but the mulatto s heart was with it, and he was driven back to it next day, when, on reconnoitering through the</p>
<p>window, he found policeman walters in possession. he waited three days longer, and then his piety or his superstition drove him to try once more. inspector baynes, who,</p>
<p>with his usual astuteness, had minimized the incident before me, had really recognized its importance and had left a trap into which the creature walked. any other point,</p>
<p>watson?" "the torn bird, the pail of blood, the charred bones, all the mystery of that weird kitchen?" holmes smiled as he turned up an entry in his</p>
<p>note-book, "i spent a morning in the british museum reading up on that and other points. here is a quotation from eckermann s voodooism and the negroid religions:</p>
<p>" the true Voodoo-worshipper attempts nothing of importance without certain sacrifices which are intended to propitiate his unclean gods, in extreme cases these rites take the form of</p>
<p>human sacrifices followed by cannibalism. the more usual victims are a white cock, which is plucked in pieces alive, or a black goat, whose throat is cut and</p>
<p>body burned, "so you see our savage friend was very orthodox in his ritual. it is grotesque, Watson," holmes added, as he slowly fastened his notebook, "but, as</p>
<p>i have had occasion to remark, there is but one step from the grotesque to the horrible." mr. hungerton, her father, really was the most tactless person upon</p>
<p>earth,--a fluffy, feathery, untidy cockatoo of a man, perfectly good-natured, but absolutely centered upon his own silly self. if anything could have driven me from gladys, it would</p>
<p>have been the thought of such a father-in-law. i am convinced that he really believed in his heart that i came round to the chestnuts three days a</p>
<p>week for the pleasure of his company, and very especially to hear his views upon bimetallism, a sub/"ect upon which he was by way of being an authority.</p>
<p>for an hour or more that evening i listened to his monotonous chirrup about bad money driving out good, the token value of silver, the depreciation of the</p>
<p>rupee, and the true standards of exchange. "suppose," he cried with feeble violence, "that all the debts in the world were called up simultaneously, and immediate payment insisted</p>
<p>upon,--what under our present conditions would happen then?" i gave the self-evident answer that i should be a ruined man, upon which he jumped from his chair, reproved</p>
<p>me for my habitual levity, which made it impossible for him to discuss any reasonable subject in my presence, and bounced off out of the room to dress</p>
<p>for a masonic meeting. at last i was alone with gladys, and the moment of fate had come! all that evening i had felt like the soldier who</p>
<p>awaits the signal which will send him on a forlorn hope; hope of victory and fear of repulse alternating in his mind. she sat with that proud, delicate</p>
<p>profile of hers outlined against the red curtain. how beautiful she was! and yet how aloof! we had been friends, quite good friends; but never could i get</p>
<p>beyond the same comradeship which i might have established with one of my fellow-reporters upon the gazette,--perfectly frank, perfectly kindly, and perfectly unsexual. my instincts are all against</p>
<p>a woman being too frank and at her ease with me. it is no compliment to a man. where the real sex feeling begins, timidity and distrust are</p>
<p>its companions, heritage from old wicked days when love and violence went often hand in hand. the bent head, the averted eye, the faltering voice, the wincing figure--</p>
<p>these, and not the unshrinking gaze and frank reply, are the true signals of passion, even in my short life i had learned as much as that--or had</p>
<p>inherited it in that race memory which we call instinct. gladys was full of every womanly quality. some iudged her to be cold and hard; but such a</p>
<p>thought was treason. that delicately bronzed skin, almost oriental in its coloring, that raven hair, the large liquid eyes, the full but exquisite lips,--all the stigmata of passion</p>
<p>were there. but i was sadly conscious that up to now i had never found the secret of drawing it forth. however, come what might, i should have</p>
<p>done with suspense and bring matters to a head to-night. she could but refuse me, and better be a repulsed lover than an accepted brother. so far my</p>
<p>thoughts had carried me, and i was about to break the long and uneasy silence, when two critical, dark eyes looked round at me, and the proud head</p>
<p>was shaken in smiling reproof. "i have a presentiment that you are going to propose, ned. i do wish you wouldn t; for things are so much nicer</p>
<p>as they are." i drew my chair a little nearer. "now, how did you know that i was going to propose?" i asked in genuine wonder. "don</p>
