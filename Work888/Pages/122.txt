<p>and he asked to get in. deanerio said he d play if he and e.c. put in four each and</p>
<p>benno put in eight. "oh, man, deanerio, you forget benno threw out his marbles?" e.c. said. "what you thinking?" "his</p>
<p>handicap, he better than us. he gotta put in more." deanerio would like to become a fine lawyer: slow game</p>
<p>and plenty of argument. benno wasn t about to talk away any more recess. he put in the marbles, eight.</p>
<p>e.c. won the lag from deanerio-benno shooting third-another concession to legal man. e.c. fumbled out with an old lady shot</p>
<p>and hardly disturbed the bunched-up marbles. deanerio, for all the five, shot one marble out. next, shot, he didn t</p>
<p>stick the shooter, lost the turn. benno hunched over, calculating the easy shot, the leave, the next shot. he cocked</p>
<p>his thumb till it blanched tan and his eyes raked to the target cat s-eye and clack, the aggie took</p>
<p>it out. he moved in the circle. clack, three inches away, the second cat s-eye. the aggie spun up a</p>
<p>blur. clack, a third cat s-eye. clack. clack. clack. clack. benno eventually took them all. "another game?" benno asked. he</p>
<p>dropped the winnings in the open mouth of his flour sack. "the way you play, you gotta put in more,</p>
<p>put in sixteen, we put in four. that s your new handicap." beating deanerio had a big price, like marbles</p>
<p>were only the excuse to argue. e.c., always agreeable, smiled. "what if i put in four," benno asked, "e.c. put</p>
<p>in four, you put in zero?" with that remark, benno knew deanerio ioined fared on the new list of guys</p>
<p>that would refuse to play. his stomach suddenly felt hollow at the idea that he could have everyone quit playing</p>
<p>on him before he d won enough marbles. that night, benno watched his mom wash dishes with a soapy rag.</p>
<p>she had her hair up, she was perspiring, she looked slimmer than usual wearing that stained and frayed apron. he</p>
<p>ate oatmeal raisin cookies, his favorite, and drank milk. "benno, why you so hungry." you ate dinner only two hours</p>
<p>ago." "i be having some dessert, a nightcap before bed." "what a growing boy you are. i just wish more</p>
<p>of you would grow up than out." the reminders about his weight were so tiresome. he toyed with the empty</p>
<p>milk carton, held it up. "mom, you mash these, be recycling, don t you?" "why you ask?" "i just wonder</p>
<p>if i can have them for keeping stuff." "you wash it first, hear." a guy benno did like to play</p>
<p>was cleveland. cleveland was good. quiet, all concentration. a lot like benno s style. they d stopped by a chalk</p>
<p>circle the top of the playground, next to the brick school building, well away from screeching hopscotchers. once his growth</p>
<p>spurt started, cleveland got to be a long, tall hoopster. benno was afraid he d quit marbles altogether, make basketball</p>
<p>his main game. "you like potsie, seven in each?" benno asked his towering companion. "potsie s okay, but i rather</p>
<p>play honeypotsie. you cool on that?" "honeypotsie? whoa!" benno didn t know. chancy game. cleveland tossed his marbles bag between</p>
<p>his two palms, sized like pancakes. benno had to take it or leave it. cleveland looked elsewhere, moved his head</p>
<p>with a b-ball fake, like he was peeping another game across the way. the game was all or nothing. knock</p>
<p>out the honeypot marble and everything else was his. benno could use seven quick marbles. he held out a black</p>
<p>purie. "for the honeypot, we use this." with one hand, cleveland wrapped his long fingers around the marbles bag and</p>
<p>with the other, counted out the seven marbles they were each in for. cleveland won the lag and let benno</p>
<p>go first. to dislodge the honeypot, center of the bunch, on the first shot was almost impossible. benno knelt, fired</p>
<p>his aggie, slightly off to the right. three marbles popped loose. cleveland s turn. again, like benno, he broke a</p>
<p>few away from the bunch, benno scooted to the other side. attack the marbles from there. it did no good</p>
<p>to hit the honeypot, unless it could roll out. he aimed once more off center, his aggie rifling across the</p>
<p>asphalt and slamming the bunched marbles. the aggie stuck, spun furiously in place. three more marbles scattered. cleveland concentrated, like</p>
<p>thought energies would move marbles, give him an opening. hopeless. on all sides, the black purie was blocked. cleveland squatted,</p>
<p>his fist just outside the chalk line, pitted shooter snug against his thumb. benno laser-eyed the thumb, tried giving it</p>
<p>a iinx. a flick and out shot the missile, blasting the marble in front of the honeypot. almost quicker than</p>
<p>benno could follow, the black purie popped up like a fourth of iuly rocket. he held his breath. the black</p>
<p>purie came down and rolled. benno felt like someone had personally stuck a cold stiletto knife in his belly. he</p>
<p>d never seen this happen before. the black purie rolled across the chalk line, out and game over. he was</p>
<p>dead, then he looked around. that nappyhead iared had seen the whole thing, gave benno a mocking eye. "you ain</p>
<p>t about nothing." benno looked away. cleveland was quietly gathering all he d won. "that bag of yours, it too</p>
<p>skinny," iared said, now louder. benno glowered back at iared. "what i tell you, you get paid end of the</p>
<p>month." he had just lost seven marbles and didn t have the energy to bust that flicted grin off fared</p>
<p>s face. "you lose bad here, i worry." benno said nothing. turned away and walked. that fared was pure pest.</p>
<p>a chigger bug that won t let off biting your arm. benno couldn t shake him. one way or the</p>
<p>other, he d pay him back. he d do just that. do what father pauley said was right. if fared</p>
<p>wasn t enough of a bother, benno was also getting irked by the sight of theron, who d taken</p>
