<p>harbour, dotted with sails; men-of-war lay at anchor, among them the little ruby, commander dibbs s cruiser. pleasure-steamers went hurrying along to many shady harbours," a tall-masted schooner</p>
<p>rode grandly in between the heads, balanced with foam; and a beach beneath them shone like opal." it was a handsome sight. for a time they were silent.</p>
<p>at last he said: "i know i haven t much to recommend me. i m a little beggar -- nothing to look at; i in pretty poor; i</p>
<p>ve had no influence to push me on; and just at the critical point in my career -- when i was expecting promotion -- i get this set-back,</p>
<p>and lose your good opinion, which is more to me, though i say it bluntly like a sailor, than the praise of all the lords of the admiralty,</p>
<p>if it could be got. you see, i always was ambitious; i was certain i d be a captain; i swore i d be an admiral one day;</p>
<p>and i fell in love with the best girl in the world, and said i d not give up thinking i would marry her until and unless i</p>
<p>saw her wearing another man s name -- and i don t know that i should even then." "now that sounds complicated -- or wicked," she said, her</p>
<p>face turned away from him. "believe me, it is not complicated; and men marry widows sometimes." "you are shocking," she said, turning on him with a flush to</p>
<p>her cheek and an angry glitter in her eye. "how dare you speak so cold-bloodedly and thoughtlessly?" "i am not cold-blooded or thoughtless, nor yet shocking. i only</p>
<p>speak what is in my mind with my usual crudeness. i know it sounds insolent of me, but, after all, it is only being bold with the woman</p>
<p>for whom -- half- disgraced, insignificant, but unquenchable fellow as i am -- i d do as much as, and, maybe, dare more for than any one of</p>
<p>the men who would marry her if they could." "i like ambitious men," she said relenting, and meditatively pushing the grass with her tennis-racket; "but ambition isn t</p>
<p>everything, is it? there must be some kind of fulfilment to turn it into capital, as it were, don t let me hurt your feelings, but you haven</p>
<p>t done a great deal yet, have you?" "no, i haven t. there must be occasion. the chance to do something big may start up any time, however.</p>
<p>you never can tell when things will come your way. you ve got to be ready, that s all." "you are very confident." "you ll call me a</p>
<p>prig directly, perhaps, but i can t help that. i ve said things to you that i ve never said to any one in the world, and i</p>
<p>don t regret saying them." she looked at him earnestly. she had never been made love to in this fashion. there was no sentimentalism in it, only straightforward</p>
<p>feeling, forceful, yet gentle. she knew he was aware that the admiral of his squadron had paid, and was paying, court to her; that a titled aide- de-camp</p>
<p>at government house was conspicuously attentive; that one of the richest squatters in the country was ready to make astonishing settlements at any moment; and that there was</p>
<p>not a young man of note acquainted with her who did not offer her gallant service-in the ball- room. she smiled as she thought of it. he was</p>
<p>certainly not large, but no finer head was ever set on a man s shoulders, powerful, strongly outlined, nobly balanced. the eyes were everywhere; searching, indomitable, kind, it</p>
<p>was a head for a sculptor. ambition became it well. she had studied that head from every stand-point, and had had the keenest delight in talking to the</p>
<p>man. but, as he said, that was two years before, and he had had bad luck since then. she suddenly put this question to him: "tell me all</p>
<p>the truth about that accident to the ruby. you have been hiding something. the admiral was right, i know. some evidence was not forthcoming that would have thrown</p>
<p>a different light on the affair." "i can tell you nothing," he promptly replied. "i shall find out one day," she said. "i hope not; though i m</p>
<p>grateful that you wish to do so." he rose hurriedly to his feet; he was looking at the harbour below. he raised the field-glass he had carried from</p>
<p>the veranda to his eyes. he was watching a yacht making across the bay towards them. she spoke again. "you are going again to-morrow?" "yes; all the ships</p>
<p>of the squadron but one get away." "how long fhall you be gone?" "six months at least -- -- great god!" he had not taken the glasses from</p>
<p>his eyes as they talked, but had watched the yacht as she came on to get under the lee of the high shore at their right. he had</p>
<p>noticed that one of those sudden fierce winds, called southerly busters, was sweeping down towards the craft, and would catch it when it came round sharp, as</p>
