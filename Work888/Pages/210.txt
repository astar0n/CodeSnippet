<p>i mean," "i do, sweet witch," "good, first off, boy, tell us your names." ted managed to tell the two</p>
<p>strange people his name, and that of his partner in crime. "ted and zed. sounds like a comedy couple," william</p>
<p>snickered. "william, please pay attention. these two were trying to murder us. that is not a laughing matter," hilda said,</p>
<p>missing the ioke. she turned to ted again. "you may have understood that we are a witch and a wizard.</p>
<p>the real deal." she showed her wand. "this is not a stick, this is a magical wand. and i know</p>
<p>how to use it. so no tricks. do we have an understanding?" ted nodded as if his life depended on</p>
<p>it, rattling his teeth as he went along. with all that had been happening in the last few minutes, he</p>
<p>was ready to believe anything this strange woman said. he tried to iolt as he saw the wand vanish. the</p>
<p>spell prevented him from doing such a thing, though. "now. slowly and from the start, because i am not from</p>
<p>here. who are you and what do you want to do with that package?" hilda asked. ted was temporarily distracted</p>
<p>by zed, who tried to convince ted to "gmmvvvm", otherwise "brrrfff-" would be the consequence. "don t worry about zep,"</p>
<p>hilda said, "he s quite harmless." ted did not chance a thing, so he let the zep slip. "we were</p>
<p>asked by some friends to come here and collect the package that was waiting for us here." "look here, son,"</p>
<p>said william. "we don t look like we re from here, and she isn t. but i am. your package</p>
<p>contains drugs. you coming here for that means you are into drugs. and we don t like drugs, nor the</p>
<p>people who deal with them. so my advice to you is to tell us the story." calmly, william held his</p>
<p>hand out, right in front of ted s face. then he made his white and red wand appear. "see, she</p>
<p>is not the only one who can do a trick or two." ted stared at the wand in william s</p>
<p>hand. zed had fallen silent as all his attempts to attract attention had failed utterly, and the more he tried,</p>
<p>the more his face hurt. "if you are trying to freak me out," said ted, "you are seriously succeeding, man."</p>
<p>his eyes seemed glued to william s wand. "we re not in the freak out business, ted. we re here</p>
<p>to catch a witch. and do something about you and your drugs as we re here anyway." the word drugs</p>
<p>made ted look at william again. "you probably are aware that you can t win, right?" hilda added. ted s</p>
<p>eyes went fuzzy for a while; he was thinking. then he agreed that he as well as zed had little</p>
<p>choice, even if zed was harder to convince. "now, we are going to make this easy on ourselves," william informed</p>
<p>the drug runners. "we re going to deliver you to the police station, and there you will tell the officers</p>
<p>eventhing you know of the drug thing you are involved in. is that clear?" ted nodded. if they could get</p>
<p>away from it all this easily, these strange people were soft in the head. he glanced over at zed, whose</p>
<p>eyes screamed no but whose head slowly nodded also. zed had reached the same decision, apparently. "wonderful. now, to make</p>
<p>sure you will do as we ask of you, we need to have a safety. the witch here will take</p>
<p>care of that." william was very calm as he said that, which worried ted and zed. hilda waved her wand</p>
<p>and said something in latin while looking at the two captives. "good. you will tell the police people the truth.</p>
<p>otherwise you ll find out that you should have." ted asked: "what did you do? i feel nothing." "that s</p>
<p>the nice bit," hilda replied, "you won t feel a thing. hah, i know my spells!" then she turned to</p>
<p>zed. "do you think you can stay quiet without my help?" zed nodded. he was ready to do a lot</p>
<p>of things now, if only he could move his lips again. "good." a moment later, zed s mouth was free</p>
<p>again, making him gasp for air in a reflex, the past experience had made the man wiser: he kept his</p>
<p>mouth shut. william rubbed his chin for a moment. "i have an idea. hilda, watch these two for a moment,</p>
<p>please." he got up and walked over to the table, where the fake drugs package was lying. after some magic,</p>
<p>and with a smile on his face, he turned to ted. "here. you will take this with you." ted hesitated</p>
<p>before accepting the package. certainly these two weirdos were not so stupid as to let them get away with the</p>
<p>shipment? the two weirdos had something better planned, though. hilda went to fetch their brooms while william kept an eye</p>
<p>on their guests. "right then, gentlemen. up you stand, and then up we go." zed could not hold back. "are</p>
<p>you crazy." do you think you can fly that thing?" he knew he risked a locked mouth again, but some</p>
<p>things /"ust needed to be said. hilda however did not take offense. "i don t think so, zed. i know</p>
<p>so. come, come, outside." she opened the door and walked into the narrow alley. the two men, ted holding the</p>
<p>package tightly under an arm, shuffled into the cramped passageway, uncertain of what was going to happen. when the first</p>
<p>thing happened, ted stepped back, bumping into zed, who uttered a curse as his partner in crime stepped on his</p>
<p>toes. "you, ted. step up here and sit down. at the front." hilda pointed at the broom that hovered next</p>
<p>to her, "oh no. no way." ted was determined to stay sane. and on the ground. hilda sighed. "perhaps this</p>
<p>was a weak part of the plan, william," they had not counted on resistance in this stage. "plan b,</p>
