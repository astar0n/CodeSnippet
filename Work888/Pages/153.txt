<p>it s an actual psychic event. you know i ve always said that i was..., psychic, i mean. that s</p>
<p>just too much! we could probably get on tv or something." "it is amazing," replied cassiopia with a wince. "hey,</p>
<p>that was a hot dream too, i mean there was these handsome guys in tuxedos and they.." cassiopia interrupted, "i</p>
<p>get the picture, bren, no need to elaborate, okay?" but it was no use. markman sat to one side of</p>
<p>the very large oak desk, facing the overstressed chancellor behind it. to his right sat a third person, someone unexpected.</p>
<p>the university had called in the fbi. agent ann rogers wore a dark, very well-fitting suit that could almost have</p>
<p>been worn by a man. not a hair was out of place. it was kept short, and perfectly captured. her</p>
<p>makeup was light and precisely applied. she was thin-lipped and had a narrow, terse stare. markman knew he was dealing</p>
<p>with a perfectionist. to his relief, the meeting was kept short. agent rogers was devoting her efforts to the computer</p>
<p>breach, and only needed an overview of dr. cassell s absence. markman reassured them that foul play was very unlikely.</p>
<p>dr. cassell s daughter was across the hall in the waiting room, and she agreed that some extraordinary opportunity had</p>
<p>probably popped up and her father had taken off on a spur of the moment hoping to capitalize on it.</p>
<p>they listened patiently and expressed reassurance at that. but, markman had felt agent rogers studying him out of the corner</p>
<p>of her eye. it would not be long before she was between him and the case of the missing doctor.</p>
<p>the ride home was moody. cassiopia stared quietly out the passenger window as though she were in deep thought about</p>
<p>something. markman draped one hand over the steering wheel and tried to relax. when the convenience store near the house</p>
<p>came into view, he decided to stop to replenish the cassell supply of coffee, an item that had been in</p>
<p>frequent demand lately. they parked directly in front of the glass store front, next to a beat-up old pickup truck.</p>
<p>inside the store, a heated argument was going on between the lone clerk and a grumpy-looking male customer. the two</p>
<p>were at odds across the checkout counter and the situation appeared to be worsening. markman cast an annoyed look at</p>
<p>his passenger. "evenwhere i go lately," he said. "you don t have to go in," she retorted sarcastically. he climbed</p>
<p>from the car, keeping a watchful eye on the escalating dispute, while cassiopia waited and observed. the muted voices quickly</p>
<p>changed from insistent to cutting as he pushed his way inside. he recognized the cashier as the older gentleman who</p>
<p>had mistaken him for someone else just a few days earlier. the gray-haired man eyed markman with a worried look</p>
<p>while trying to maintain his posture in the volatile exchange. "listen, by law i cannot sell you this. if you</p>
<p>go back out on the road and kill somebody they d hang me too," the merchant insisted while tapping the</p>
<p>cap of the bottle that sat on the counter top. "i ain t drunk and you re gonna sell me</p>
<p>this or you re goin through that plate glass winda , head first," slurred the red-faced customer. markman glanced out</p>
<p>the window at cassiopia and rolled his eyes in disgust. he came up beside the two men. "excuse me, can</p>
<p>you tell me where the coffee is?" the intoxicated patron turned abruptly and snarled, "now who the hell asked you</p>
<p>to butt in, asshole?" markman quietly shook his head, "no, i /"ust need some coffee, that s all. it s</p>
<p>cool." the glassy-eyed customer swayed slightly, keeping one hand on the counter for balance. he tilted his head as though</p>
<p>to belch, but nothing happened. he turned back to the clerk. "ring it up, right now or i ll beat</p>
<p>your ass." markman interrupted. "sir, are you driving that pickup parked out there?" "i told you to bug off." "did</p>
<p>he just drive up in that?" asked markman of the old man behind the counter. he had taken a step</p>
<p>back and folded his arms in front of him. "yes, he did." "hey, you know that thing qualifies for classic</p>
<p>tags? that thing s probably worth some money. mister, why don t you step outside with me and let me</p>
<p>take a look at it. i might be interested." markman s body had already tightened up. "for the last time,"</p>
<p>answered the unsteady man. "get out of my face. i about had it with you." markman had only to touch</p>
<p>the man s left shoulder, and the melee began. the drunk s right fist shot up at markman s face</p>
<p>but was slow and uncoordinated, hardly even a challenge. markman leaned back almost casually without taking his eyes off him,</p>
<p>and let the misguided punch sail harmlessly past. the off-balance motion caused the drunk to spin around and fall forward</p>
<p>on the counter, wiping out a display rack of cds and the colorful cardbread signs that urged their sale. the</p>
<p>displaced entourage crashed to the floor and scattered evenwhere on the slick tile. markman braced his right hand and body</p>
<p>weight against the man s back and pinned him to the counter. he got control of the dirty, flailing left</p>
<p>arm and wrenched it up behind, capturing him in an arm lock, but being careful not to harm him. this</p>
<p>man was probably a decent person when sober, and who was to say his reasons for drinking weren t painfully</p>
<p>severe, thought markman. "if you ll open the door, i ll take him outside," he said to the storekeeper, who</p>
<p>quickly responded by racing around from behind the protective counter and pushing open one of the heavy glass doors. "wide</p>
<p>and deep, madam," replied ayrton; "a mile wide, with an impetuous current. a good swimmer could not go over without</p>
<p>danger." "let us build a boat then," said robert, who never stuck at anything. "we have only to cut</p>
