<p>said, surprised by his comment. "but you could easily have an extraordinary port. the river that runs from king s</p>
<p>lake to the sea. could quickly become an estuary leading ships from sea to a huge lake port. you could</p>
<p>invite trade to and from the ends of the earth. i can envision an unending line of ships, going and</p>
<p>coming, bringing fine cloth, spices, wines, iewelsthose same ships carrying away the gifts of your forests and rivers. and of</p>
<p>course, a tax on all for the privilege of docking at your port." "king geoffrey has never spoken of it.</p>
<p>perhaps it would be more difficult than you imagine." "we see through the eyes of a seafaring people. for us,</p>
<p>it would not be difficult. for us, the work would be a blessing. and in return for such a blessing,</p>
<p>i envision the gift we would leave with you. a beautiful golden barge, a royal barge, navigating the estuary, sailing</p>
<p>through the forest of fernland all the way from the king s lake to the river s end. she rides</p>
<p>triumphantly, decked out in pennants and banners, bearing the crest of the dragon. i see myself designing such a vessel.</p>
<p>i see it coming to life with the skilled hands of my meater ship builders." delphinia s eyes followed the</p>
<p>caliph s in his flight of fancy. "is such a dream possible?" she asked. "of course. not only possible, i</p>
<p>believe it is destined to be. think of the improbable series of events which has brought us here to you.</p>
<p>i am a great believer in destiny. we could use the wood from your forest to build the barge. for</p>
<p>this we could set up our staging area alongside the lake. we could harbor our ships temporarily on the lake,</p>
<p>once we have completed the necessary dredging." "but why would you do all this for us?" delphinia asked. "it is</p>
<p>what we do. we are ship builders and sea traders. we go where the wind takes us." "i must tell</p>
<p>king geoffrey about this," delphinia said. "oh, here he is now." delphinia smiled and waved to king geoffrey as he</p>
<p>and muller entered the reception hall. queen delphinia, eyes shining with excitement, rushed to tell geoffrey of the caliph s</p>
<p>offer. king geoffrey, his face flushed with anger, his mouth a determined scowl, rushed to warn delphinia of the threat</p>
<p>the caliph posed to fernland. they met in the middle of the reception hall, surrounded by ministers and dinner guests.</p>
<p>king geoffrey easily spotted the visitors from taz in the crowded reception room. they wore bright colored robes with matching</p>
<p>turbans. traders. men practiced in the art of selling. when he saw the excitement on delphinia s face, he feared</p>
<p>the worst. they had no doubt found a thing she wanted to buy. a point to begin negotiations. geoffrey was</p>
<p>quite sure he wanted nothing they had to sell. he wanted them gone from fernland and the sooner the better.</p>
<p>"geoffrey." i am so anxious for you to meet the caliph. he has told me so much about his life</p>
<p>and he has such wonderful ideas." delphinia was aglow with enthusiasm. "has he told you where they plan to settle</p>
<p>now taz has been taken from them?" geoffrey asked, his face shadowed with suspicion, "no, we have not spoken of</p>
<p>that. but we have spoken of his first impressions of fernland, were you aware that with a little work we</p>
<p>could make river s end into an estuary? we could harbor large ships on king s lake. even a royal</p>
<p>barge." "yes, of course i was aware of that," king geoffrey said, wondering if this were true. "i never saw</p>
<p>the need of it." "need? perhaps not. though it might prove convenient to have our own port and perhaps pleasurable</p>
<p>to have such a barge." delphinia paused when she saw the anger in geoffrey s eyes. "we only touched on</p>
<p>the sub/"ect. i m sure he would feel more comfortable speaking to you about it." "no doubt he is anxious</p>
<p>to get back to his ships. perhaps i will speak to him during dinner." queen delphinia looked at geoffrey with</p>
<p>a curious expression. "i ve not had time to arrange a proper banquet to receive our guests, but i believe</p>
<p>our staff has risen to the challenge on short notice. now that you have arrived, we may announce dinner." "fine.</p>
<p>please seat electra on my right." a quick change of seating assignments found queen delphinia on geoffrey s left and</p>
<p>electra on his right. queen delphinia had hoped to speak to electra during dinner. she had thought of several more</p>
<p>reasons that spoke against electra s plan to attend a school of medicine. she assumed that king geoffrey had asked</p>
<p>that she be seated next to him for the same reason. she hoped he had thought of a good argument</p>
<p>to dissuade their daughter from this latest foolishness. as dinner began, electra seemed wholly concentrated on the food in front</p>
<p>of her. oddly, king geoffrey seemed like-minded. what had come over everyone, delphinia wondered. no one seemed inclined to conversation.</p>
<p>"how do you find the soup?" delphinia asked king geoffrey. "the what?" "the soup." "oh, yes, the soup." king geoffrey</p>
<p>could not remember if he had tasted the soup yet. "quite good." he tasted it and found it over salted.</p>
<p>delphinia tried again. "electra, have you thought more on our arguments against your going to a school of medicine?" delphinia</p>
<p>hoped this would encourage king geoffrey to offer any new arguments he had devised. "i am still sifting through them,"</p>
<p>electra said. the caliph, on electra s right, looked up, interested. "you contemplate the study of medicine?" he asked. "perhaps,"</p>
<p>she said, inspecting her soup. "had you a school in mind?" the caliph asked. electra looked at the caliph for</p>
<p>the first time. "i have heard praise for egina." she watched for his reaction. "i have been to egina several</p>
<p>times." the caliph now had the attention not only of electra, but the king and queen as well. "how</p>
