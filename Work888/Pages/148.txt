<p>were fifty paces across a modest car park. just outside the door, a small patio area with two wooden rockers</p>
<p>and a builtin barbeque, added ?ome ambiance. sitting at just the right angle in the chairs afforded a view of</p>
<p>the permanent cloud of mist that marks the falls. as well, they could hear the roar of the falls, providing</p>
<p>faint and unending background noise. they could see and hear why the natives called it mosioatunya, the smoke that thunders.</p>
<p>after a quick look around the room and a feel of the bed, chad said, "let s go." they tossed</p>
<p>their rucksacks on their beds and headed off to explore the falls. within 100 meters of the falls, the vegetation</p>
<p>thickens. a little further and one is engulfed by a iungle, which is fueled by the neverending spray of the</p>
<p>falls. at twenty meters, it morphs into a virtual rainforest overwhelmed with a rich variety of trees, brush, vines, and</p>
<p>fauna. the area close to the falls nurtures several hundred types of trees and plants rarely seen in other parts</p>
<p>of africa. all who Venture close enough to the falls enjoy a drenching by the eternal upward rain produced by</p>
<p>a thousand tons of water plunging over the falls every second. hurrying before dark, they made their way down a</p>
<p>wellused path and came to the northern end of the falls. standing a meter from the edge, they gazed over</p>
<p>the rim, speechless. the ma/"esty of victoria falls evokes awe and demands reverence. the magnitude of its power arouses a</p>
<p>quiet fear - a fear of the ab."olute authority that nature yields. peter whispered, "this is more amazing than i</p>
<p>could have imagined. too much for words. /"ust  just amazing." "an adrenaline rush as good as any. as good</p>
<p>as swine," chad whispered back. they returned to their motel and enioyed peanut butter and /"am sandwiches, then, with hot</p>
<p>tea in hand, they sat in the rocking chairs and listened to the thundering mist as they reflected on the</p>
<p>splendor of one of africa S greatest gifts. the following morning, they set off to explore deeper and further, they</p>
<p>trekked around the perimeter of the falls, heading ?outh and east, working their way toward the railroad bridge that crosses</p>
<p>the zambezi river into zambia. with the vegetation closing in with each step, peter blurted out a question he had</p>
<p>been mulling over, "what do you think we re more likely to run into up here, a terrorist or a</p>
<p>wild animal? a terr or a crocodile." or worse, a black mamba?" "more likely a deadly animal. that is scary</p>
<p>for sure. there re no terrorists around here. they would have told us if there were, but i don t</p>
<p>want to think about either." they followed the rim of the falls, often walking a meter or less from its</p>
<p>edge. they stopped and took pictures of the zambian bridge, which was about a kilometer away. they trudged through another</p>
<p>drenching from the falls spray, came to a clearing, and took more photos, capturing a train crossing over the bridge.</p>
<p>time seemed to stop as they sat and watched the neverending rush of water plunging down the mﬂmeter gorge; both</p>
<p>mesmerized by the maiesty and power before their eyes. peter broke their quiet meditation. "good god! it s well past</p>
<p>noon. no wonder my stomach s complaining. let s get back and get ?ome lunch. and i don t want</p>
<p>to get drenched again. we should walk further in from the falls, that path over there should be a quicker</p>
<p>way back to the motel." "fine," chad said. they ventured down a path less traveled; it faded quickly as the</p>
<p>fauna, trees, and undergrowth thickened. peter s voice became louder with each sentence. "i don t know about this. should</p>
<p>we turn back? why the hell didn t we bring ?ome lunch anyway? how many times, huh? how many times</p>
<p>did i say, we should take ?omething to eat ? but no... you said, let s get going. we ll</p>
<p>/ust come back for lunch. how many" "god." it s too late now. shut up about it. it s fine.</p>
<p>just keep going. i think there s a clearing ahead. this was your idea, remember." the iungle began to smother</p>
<p>them. complaints grew more heated and more anxious. peter was about to declare they should turn around when they saw</p>
<p>two young baboons. the inquisitive primates stared at them with large, questioning eyes, peter slowly pulled out his kodak and</p>
<p>handed it to chad. he whispered, "we ve gotta get this." peter edged nearer, holding out his hand. both tiny</p>
<p>baboons reached out to touch his fingers, as they did, chad took the picture and then handed the camera to</p>
<p>peter as he eased away. chad took two steps toward the .V"§ung baboons. at that moment, out of the thick</p>
<p>vegetation, a bloodcurdlingly roar pierced their eardrums, and a large baboon swooped toward peter and slapped him on the head.</p>
<p>another roar exploded from the depths of the patriarch s lungs as he raised both arms and prepared to strike</p>
<p>again. at the same moment, two other adult baboons appeared bearing large, sharp, angry teeth, declaring an attack was imminent.</p>
<p>chad darted toward a stunned peter, grabbed his wrist, and yanked him away from the next blow. the two humans</p>
<p>backed slowly away from the irate beasts. at once, both turned and darted toward the rough brush, which fought against</p>
<p>them with its own anger; every stride produced tears, scratches, and cuts, after ten minutes (which seemed like sixty}, they</p>
<p>stopped. the roars had faded; the baboons had made their point and did not bother to elaborate further. peter bent</p>
<p>over and grabbed his knees. chad clasped his hands on his head. both were panting, and their heart rates would</p>
<p>not slow down. after several minutes, when their panic had subsided, both laughed with loud, husky laughter that released tension</p>
<p>and brought their adrenaline back down to a tolerable level. after calm had returned, peter looked around. he was</p>
