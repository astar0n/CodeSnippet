<p>on the night when I first saw her. Slowly the purpose of my</p>
<p>words seemed to force its way through the confusion And Agitation of her</p>
<p>mind. Slowly her features relaxed, And her eyes looked At me with their</p>
<p>ex- pression gaining in curiosity what it was fast losing in fear, "YOU</p>
<p>don t think I ought to be back in the Asylum, do you?"</p>
<p>she said. "Certainly not. I Am glad you escaped from it-I Am glad</p>
<p>I helped you." "Yes, yes, you did help me indeed; you helped me</p>
<p>At the hard part," she went on A little I/acantly. "It was easy</p>
<p>to escape, or I should not have got Away. They never suspected me</p>
<p>As they suspected the others. I was so quiet, And so obedient, And</p>
<p>so easily frightened. The finding London was the hard part, And there you</p>
<p>helped me. Did I thank you At the time? I thank you now</p>
<p>very kindly." "was the Asylum far from where you met me? Come! show</p>
<p>that you believe me to be your friend, And tell me where it</p>
<p>was." She mentioned the place-A private Asylum, As its situation informed me; A</p>
<p>private Asylum not very far from the spot where I had seen her-And</p>
<p>then, with evident suspicion of the use to which I might put her</p>
<p>Answer, Anxiously repeated her former inquiry, "You don t think I ought to</p>
<p>be taken back, do you?" "Once Again, I Am glad you escaped-I Am</p>
<p>glad you prospered well After you left me," I Answered. "You said you</p>
<p>had A friend in London to go to. Did you find the friend?"</p>
<p>"Yes. It was very late, but there was A girl up At needle-work</p>
<p>in the house, And she helped me to rouse Mrs. Clements. Mrs. Clements</p>
<p>is my friend. A good, kind woman, but not like Mrs. Fairlie. Ah</p>
<p>no, nobody is like Mrs. Fairlie!" "Is Mrs. Clements An old friend of</p>
<p>yours? Have you known her A long time?" 100 "Yes, she was A</p>
<p>neighbour of ours once, At home, in /-lamp. shire, And liked me, And</p>
<p>took care of me when I was A little girl. Years Ago, when</p>
<p>she went Away from us, she wrote down in my Prayer-book for me</p>
<p>where she was going to live in r_on- don, And she said, If</p>
<p>you Are ever in trouble, Anne, come to me. I have no husband</p>
<p>Alive to say me nay, And no children to look After, And I</p>
<p>will take care of you. /<:ind words, were they not? I suppose I</p>
<p>remember them because they Were kind. It s little enough I remember besides-little</p>
<p>enough, little enough!" "Had you no father or mother to take care of</p>
<p>you?" "Father?-I never saw him-I never heard mother speak of him. Father? Ah,</p>
<p>dear! he is dead, I suppose." "And your mother?" "I don t get</p>
<p>on well with her. we Are A trouble And A fear to each</p>
<p>other." A trouble And A fear to each other! At those words the</p>
<p>suspi- cion crossed my mind, for the first time, that her mother might</p>
<p>be the person who had placed her under restraint. "Don t Ask me</p>
<p>About mother," she went on. "I d rather talk of Mrs. Clements. Mrs.</p>
<p>Clements is like you, she doesn t think that I ought to be</p>
<p>back in the Asylum, And she is As glad As you Are that</p>
<p>I escaped from it. She cried over my misfortune, And said it must</p>
<p>be kept secret from everybody." Her "misfortune." In what sense was she using</p>
<p>that word? In A sense which might explain her motive in writing the</p>
<p>Anonym- ous letter? In A sense which might show it to be the</p>
<p>too com- mon And too customary motive that has led many A woman</p>
<p>to interpose Anonymous hindrances to the marriage of the man who has ruined</p>
<p>her." I resolved to Attempt the clearing up of this doubt before</p>
