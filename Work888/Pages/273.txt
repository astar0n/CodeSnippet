<p>yawls at calcutta or madras which would serve our turn well. do you bring one over. we shall engage to get aboard her by night, and if you</p>
<p>will drop us on any part of the indian coast you will have done your part of the bargain. " if there were only one, he said. "</p>
<p>none or all, i answered. we have sworn it. the f0ur of us must always act together. " you see, morstan, said he, small is a man of</p>
<p>his word. he does not flinch from his friend. i think we may very well trust him. " it s a dirty business, the other answered. yet, as</p>
<p>you say, the money would save our commissions handsomely. " well, small, said the major, we must, i suppose, try and meet you, we must first, of course,</p>
<p>test the truth of your story. tell me where the box is hid, and i shall get leave of absence and go back to india in the monthly</p>
<p>relief-boat to inquire into the affair. " not so fast, said i, growing colder as he got hot. i must have the consent of my three comrades. i</p>
<p>tell you that it is four or none with us. " nonsense! he broke in. what have three black fellows to do with our agreement? " black or</p>
<p>blue, said i, they are in with me, and we all go together. "well, the matter ended by a second meeting, at which mahomet singh, abdullah khan, and</p>
<p>dost akbar were all present. we talked the matter over again, and at last we came to an arrangement. we were to provide both the officers with charts</p>
<p>of the part of the agra fort and mark the place in the wall where the treasure was hid. maior sholto was to go to india to test</p>
<p>our story. if he found the box he was to leave it there, to send out a small yacht provisioned for a voyage, which was to lie off</p>
<p>rutland island, and to which we were to make our way, and finally to return to his duties. captain morstan was then to apply for leave of absence,</p>
<p>to meet us at agra, and there we were to have a final division of the treasure, he taking the major s share as well as his own.</p>
<p>all this we sealed by the most solemn oaths that the mind could think or the lips utter. i sat up all night with paper and ink, and</p>
<p>by the morning i had the two charts all ready, signed with the sign of four,--that is, of abdullah, akbar, mahomet, and myself. "well, gentlemen, i weary you</p>
<p>with my long story, and i know that my friend mr. iones is impatient to get me safely stowed in chokey. i ll make it as short as</p>
<p>i can. the villain sholto went off to india, but he never came back again. captain morstan showed me his name among a list of passengers in one</p>
<p>of the mail- boats very shortly afterwards. his uncle had died, leaving him a fortune, and he had left the army, yet he could stoop to treat five</p>
<p>men as he had treated us. morstan went over to agra shortly afterwards, and found, as we expected, that the treasure was indeed gone. the scoundrel had stolen</p>
<p>it all, without carrying out one of the conditions on which we had sold him the secret. :-from that day i lived only for vengeance. i thought of</p>
<p>it by day and i nursed it by night. it became an overpowering, absorbing passion with me. i cared nothing for the law,--nothing for the gallows. to escape,</p>
<p>to track down sholto, to have my hand upon his throat,--that was my one thought. even the agra treasure had come to be a smaller thing in my</p>
<p>mind than the slaying of sholto, "well, i have set my mind on many things in this life, and never one which i did not carry out. but</p>
<p>it was weary years before my time came. i have told you that i had picked up something of medicine. one day when dr. somerton was down with</p>
<p>a fever a little andaman islander was picked up by a convict-gang in the woods. he was sick to death, and had gone to a lonely place to</p>
<p>die. i took him in hand, though he was as venomous as a young snake, and after a couple of months i got him all right and able</p>
<p>to walk. he took a kind of fancy to me then, and would hardly go back to his woods, but was always hanging about my hut. i learned</p>
<p>0. little of his lingo from him, and this made him all the fonder of me. "tonga--for that was his name--was a fine boatman, and owned a big,</p>
<p>roomy canoe of his own. when i found that he was devoted to me and would do anything to serve me, i saw my chance of escape. i</p>
<p>talked it over with him. he was to bring his boat round on a certain night to an old wharf which was never guarded, and there he</p>
