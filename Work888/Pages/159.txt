<p>"gone?" said larry. "yes, scuddy took her home." "are they all gone?" inquired larry. "yes, for the most part." "oh</p>
<p>all right then: i think i shall not go in. goodnight," he said, turned abruptly about and set off for</p>
<p>dr. brown s. he looked again at his watch. he was surprised to find it was not ?o very late.</p>
<p>why had fane not waited for him? had he hurt her again? he was ?orely disappointed. surely she had no</p>
<p>rea?on to be offended, and this was his last night. as he thought the matter over he came to the</p>
<p>conclusion that now it was he that had a grievance. arrived at dr. brown s house the only light to</p>
<p>be seen was in iane s room upstairs. should he go in or should he go home and wait till</p>
<p>to morrow. he was too miserable to think of going home without seeing her. he determined that he must see</p>
<p>her at all cost tonight. he took a pebble and {lung it up against her window, and another and another.</p>
<p>the window opened and /"ane appeared. "oh, larry," she whispered. "is it you? wait, i shall be down." she opened</p>
<p>the door for him and stood waiting for him to speak. "why didn t you wait?" he asked, passing into</p>
<p>the hall. "i was not very long." "why should i wait, larry?" she said quietly. "scuddy told me you had</p>
<p>gone home with helen." "but didn t i promise that i would take you home?" "you did, and then went</p>
<p>away." "well, all i have to say, lane, is that this is not a bit like you. i am ?orry</p>
<p>i brought you down, and i won t keep you any longer. goodnight. i shall see you tomorrow." but iane</p>
<p>got between him and the door and stood with her back to it. "no, larry, you are not going away</p>
<p>like that. go into the study." larry looked at her in astonishment. this was indeed a new iane to him.</p>
<p>wrathful, imperious, she stood waving him toward the study door. in spite of his irritation he was conscious of a</p>
<p>new admiration for her. feeling a little like a boy about to receive his punishment, he passed into the study.</p>
<p>"didn t mrs. allen give you my message?" he said. "your message, larry?" cried iane, a light breaking upon her</p>
<p>face. "did you leave a message for me?" "i did. i told mrs. allen to tell you where i had</p>
<p>gone helen was ?o anxious to go and that i would be right back." larry s voice was full of</p>
<p>reproach. "oh, larry, i am .I0 glad," said iane, her tone indicating the greatness of her relief. "i knew it</p>
<p>was all right that ?omething had prevented. i am ?o glad you came in. you must have thought me queer."</p>
<p>"no," said larry, appeased, "i knew all the time there must be ?ome explanation, only i was feeling ?o miserable."</p>
<p>"and i was miserable, too, larry," she said gently. "it seemed a pity that this should happen on our last</p>
<p>night." all her wrath was gone. she was once more the /"ane that larry had always known, gentle, sweet, straightforward,</p>
<p>and on her face the old transfiguring smile. before this change of mood all his irritation vanished. humbled, penitent, and</p>
<p>with a rush of warm affection filling his heart, he said, "i should have known you were not to blame,</p>
<p>but you are always right. never once in all these years have you failed me. you always understand a fellow.</p>
<p>do you know i am wondering how i shall ever do without you? have you thought, iane, that tomorrow this</p>
<p>old life of ours together will end?" "yes, larry." her voice was low, almost a whisper, and in her eyes</p>
<p>an eager light shone. "it just breaks my heart, iane. we have been we are such good friends. if we</p>
<p>had only fallen in love with each other. but that would have spoiled it all. we are not like other</p>
<p>people; we have been such chums, iane." "yes, larry," she said again, but the eager light had faded from her</p>
<p>eyes. "let s sit a bit, larry," she said. "i am tired, and you are tired, too," she added quickly,</p>
<p>"after your hard day." for a little time they sat in silence together, both shrinking from the parting that they</p>
<p>knew was ?o near, larry gazed at her, wondering to himself that he had ever thought her plain. tonight she</p>
<p>seemed beautiful and very dear to him. next to his mother, was her place in his heart. was this that</p>
<p>he felt for her what they called love? with all his ?oul he wished he could take her in his</p>
<p>arms and say, "iane, i love you." but still he knew that his words would not ring true. more than</p>
<p>that, iane would know it too. besides, might not her feeling for him be of the same quality? what could</p>
<p>he say in this hour which he recognised to be a crisis in their lives? sick at heart and oppressed</p>
<p>with his feeling of loneliness and impotence, he could only look at her in speechless misery. then he thought she,</p>
<p>too, was suffering, the same misery was filling her heart. she looked utterly spent and weary. "/"ane," he said desperately.</p>
<p>she started. she, too, had been thinking. "scuddy is in love with helen, macleod is in love with ethel. i</p>
<p>wish to god i had fallen in love with you and you with me. then we would have ?omething to</p>
<p>look forward to. do you know, iane, i am like a boy leaving home? we are going to drift apart.</p>
<p>others will come between us." "no, larry," cried iane with quick vehemence. "not that. you won t let that come."</p>
<p>"can we help it, /"ane?" then her weariness appealed to him. "it is a shame to keep you up. i</p>
<p>have given you a hard day, iane." she shook her head. "and there is no use waiting. we can</p>
<p>I</p>
