<p>Faggers. I1" I Could buy the furniture now hired for me, said I,</p>
<p>and one or two other little things, I should be quite at home</p>
<p>there. Go it! said Mr. Faggers, with a short laugh. I told you</p>
<p>you d get on. well! How much do you want? 34I of 865</p>
<p>Great Expectations I said I didn t know how much. Come! retorted Mr.</p>
<p>ﬂaggers. How much? Fifty pounds? Oh, not nearly so much. Five pounds? said</p>
<p>Mr. ﬂaggers. This was such a great fall, that I said in discomfiture,</p>
<p>Oh." more than that. More than that, eh! retorted Mr. Faggers, lying in</p>
<p>wait for me, with his hands in his pockets, his head on one</p>
<p>side, and his eyes on the wall behind me; how much more? It</p>
<p>is so difficult to fix a sum, said I, hesitating. Come! said Mr.</p>
<p>ilaggers. Let s get at it. Twice five; will that do? Three times</p>
<p>five; will that do? Four times five; will that do." I said I</p>
<p>thought that would do handsomely. Four times five will do handsomely, will it?</p>
<p>said Mr. Faggers, knitting his brows. Now, what do you make of four</p>
<p>times five? what do I make of it? Ah! said Mr. Faggers;</p>
