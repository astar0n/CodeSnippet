<p>i went in search of the information that you asked for. phyllis, who lives in the headmaster s office, was</p>
<p>the only one in his office willing to let me in on the sordid details of what goes on in</p>
<p>there. the portraits in the headmaster s office are bound to serve him, you see, but every so often one</p>
<p>of them breaks ranks. phyllis has never liked professor black. albus was champing at the bit to know what professor</p>
<p>longbottom had fetched for professor black. the sleepy second portrait seemed to notice how impatient he was. oh hurry up,</p>
<p>old chap, the second portrait said to the first. have you forgotten that this one is eleven years old." he</p>
<p>does not have time immemorial to sit and listen to a centuries old portrait like you blathering on! professor longbottom</p>
<p>acquired a root from the undying yew tree in the forbidden forest, the first portrait said. that is what made</p>
<p>the centaurs so angry. a root from the undying yew, albus said, frowning. thank you so very much! it was</p>
<p>a pleasure doing business with you! the first portrait called out after albus, but he had already sprinted off towards</p>
<p>the library. five hours later albus had paged through hundreds of books from the library and was near despair, having</p>
<p>been unable to find anything on the undying yew. it was only the fortuitous arrival of fawkes that saved him</p>
<p>from insanity. the phoenix took albus to a part of the restricted section that was too dark for the librarian</p>
<p>to see that he was in there. fawkes used his beak to point out a book, which albus quickly dusted</p>
<p>off and opened. it was called the darkest properties of the darkest plants. there was only a tiny section devoted</p>
<p>to the undying yew, and an even smaller sub-section on the roots of the undying yew. albus heart pounded as</p>
<p>he read it. the magic imbedded within the roots of the undying yew is among the most powerful in the</p>
<p>world. it is so powerful, that even a single crushing of the root can create a draught so toxic that</p>
<p>the fumes can kill a human being. as such, few have ever experimented with root of undying yew. however, it</p>
<p>is believed that the root of the undying yew contains the magic responsible for the tree s immortality. it has</p>
<p>often been speculated that, if a wizard could master the secret of the undying yew root, then said wizard could</p>
<p>compose themselves a draught of immortality or revitalisation. albus did not need to read the paragraph again. professor black was</p>
<p>after immortality. if he succeeded in achieving it, then he could certainly appoint professor fudge as headmaster of hogwarts. because,</p>
<p>after all, nobody would be able to stop him, would they? but what albus still could not understand was: what</p>
<p>did he have to do with it? professor black had said, all we need now is dumbledore . was the</p>
<p>blood of an eleven-year-old wizard part of the draught of immortality? far from alleviating his concerns, the discovery of what</p>
<p>professor longbottom had the only thing that gave albus peace of mind enough to sleep over the weeks that followed</p>
<p>was the fact that professor black had not yet taken over the wizarding world and appointed professor fudge as headmaster</p>
<p>of hogwarts. at the very least it meant that the evil headmaster had not yet discovered how to create a</p>
<p>draught of immortality from the root of undying yew currently in his possession. even so, albus walked around the school</p>
<p>with half a mind to keep looking over his shoulder. professor black needed him for some reason, and he did</p>
<p>not know when the headmaster was going to act against him. unfortunately for albus, support was not forthcoming from the</p>
<p>pirates. they and the rest of the school were preoccupied with the next round of quidditch matches. slytherin were to</p>
<p>play ravenclaw first up, and the saturday after would see gryffindor play against the hopeless hufflepuffs. the house championship was</p>
<p>as close as it had ever been. slytherin had regained the lead thanks to the generosity of professor fudge, but</p>
<p>were only fifty points ahead of gryffindor, who were only ten points ahead of ravenclaw. as such three houses were</p>
<p>barracking for a ravenclaw win over slytherin and even the hufflepuffs did not seem that interested in beating gryffindor. it</p>
<p>was a sign of how badly everyone else wanted to see slytherin lose the house championship at the end of</p>
<p>the year. albus was not in the slightest bit interested in the latest round of quidditch, even though he had</p>
<p>been the star seeker in gryffindor s now famous win over slytherin back in october. ionathan glastonbury had taken back</p>
<p>his place as seeker in the gryffindor team, so albus was not involved. he had ohure things on his mind.</p>
<p>that is, until someone completely unexpected confronted him. it was the end of a gruelling morning of classes monday, the</p>
<p>week of ravenclaws match against slytherin. the gryffindors had just finished a tough lesson of transfiguration with the ravenclaws. professor</p>
<p>bones had been grilling them on turning pigeons into tea cosies, and albus head hurt. he knew he would be</p>
<p>spending all night reading a better way to transfigure. just as albus trudged out the classroom into the corridor with</p>
<p>the ohure gryffindor first years, he felt something brush against his leg. next thing he knew, his bag had ripped</p>
<p>and all his books, parchments and ink bottles were tumbling to the ground. just my luck, said albus, clicking his</p>
<p>tongue. he bent down to collect all his equipment. william, mars and alabaster started as if to help him. albus</p>
<p>waved them away. don t worry about it. you chaps head off for lunch. i will be down in a</p>
<p>trice. the pirates shrugged their shoulders and sauntered off to lunch. albus knew that someone had cast a spell to</p>
<p>rip his bag open. it was a sure sign that someone wanted to talk to him alone. but he</p>
