<p>of the guards, Mihail Stepanovitch Snetkov, would now be balloted</p>
<p>for as marshal of the province. The district marshals walked</p>
<p>carrying plates, on which were balls, from their tables to</p>
<p>the high table, and the election began. Put it in</p>
<p>the right side, whispered Stepan Arkadyevitch, as with his brother</p>
<p>Levin followed the marshal of his district to the table.</p>
<p>But Levin had forgotten by now the calculations that had</p>
<p>been explained to him, and was afraid Stepan Arkadyevitch might</p>
<p>be mistaken in saying the right side, Surely Snetkov was</p>
<p>the enemy. As he went up, he held the ball</p>
<p>in his right hand, but thinking he was wrong, just</p>
<p>at the box he changed to the left hand, and</p>
<p>undoubtedly put the ball to the left. An adept in</p>
<p>the business, standing at the box and seeing by the</p>
<p>mere action of the elbow where each put his ball,</p>
<p>scowled with annoyance. It was no good for him to</p>
<p>use his insight. Everything was still, and the counting of</p>
<p>the balls was heard. Then a single voice rose and</p>
<p>proclaimed the numbers for and against. The marshal had been</p>
<p>Voted for by a considerable majority, All was noise and</p>
<p>eager 142I of II5I Anna Karenina movement towards the doors.</p>
<p>Snetkov came in, and the nobles thronged round him, congratulating</p>
<p>him. well, now is it over? Levin asked Sergey "Ivanovitch.</p>
<p>It s only just beginning, Sviazhsky said, replying for Sergey</p>
<p>It/anot/itch with a smile. Some other candidate may receive more</p>
<p>Votes than the marshal. Levin had quite forgotten about that.</p>
<p>Now he could only remember that there was some sort</p>
<p>of trickery in it, but he was too bored to</p>
<p>think what it was exactly. He felt depressed, and longed</p>
<p>to get out of the crowd. As no one was</p>
<p>paying any attention to him, and no one apparently needed</p>
<p>him, he quietly slipped away into the little room where</p>
<p>the refreshments were, and again had a great sense of</p>
<p>comfort when he saw the waiters. The little old waiter</p>
<p>pressed him to have something, and Levin agreed. After eating</p>
<p>a cutlet with beans and talking to the waiters of</p>
<p>their former masters, Levin, not wishing to go back to</p>
<p>the hall, where it was all so distasteful to him,</p>
<p>proceeded to walk through the galleries. The galleries were full</p>
<p>of fashionably dressed ladies, leaning over the balustrade and trying</p>
<p>not to lose a single word of what was being</p>
<p>said below. with the ladies were sitting and standing smart</p>
<p>law}/NS, high school teachers in spectacles, and officers. Everywhere they</p>
<p>were talking of the election, and 1428 of 1I5I Anna</p>
<p>Karenina of how worried the marshal was, and how splendid</p>
<p>the discussions had been. "in one group Levin heard his</p>
<p>brother s praises. One lady was telling a lawyer: How</p>
<p>glad I am "I heard /doznishevl "it s worth losing</p>
<p>one s dinner. He s exquisite! So clear and distinct</p>
<p>all of it! There s not one of you in</p>
<p>the law courts that speaks like that. The only one</p>
<p>is Meidel, and he s not so eloquent by a</p>
<p>long way. Finding a free place, Levin leaned over the</p>
<p>balustrade and began looking and listening. All the noblemen were</p>
<p>sitting railed off behind barriers according to their districts, "In</p>
<p>the middle of the room stood a man in</p>
