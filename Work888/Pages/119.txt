<p>same moment i was aware of the slamming of a door some way off; and again i knew which door</p>
<p>-- the little side-portal by the kitchen-entrance, leading out northward into the park -- and again something gave vigour to</p>
<p>my knees, and lifted my feet, to go to see. i made my way to the little portal; opened it</p>
<p>slowly." my soles were out on the snow. and before me on the short gravel-path going north into the park</p>
<p>i distinctly saw the pale ape, bearing a body against his breast. a moment later he laid down his heavy</p>
<p>load, and bent over it; and when i saw him horribly muttering over it, something in me stooped, took up</p>
<p>a stone, and threw it at the brute. it went straight to his head. after some seconds the creature raised</p>
<p>himself slowly, and raced with reeling feet into the darkness of the park. i staggered then to the body, and</p>
<p>saw that it was huggins lister strangled; and on the body of my beloved my senses left me. it was</p>
<p>ten in the day before i knew anything more," and then i lay on a bed, on one side of</p>
<p>it esmé, on the other side mrs, wiseman, the latter had a fixed stare; and from the manner in which</p>
<p>esme was smiling, with her face held sideward, while she persistently counted on her fingers, i could make out that</p>
<p>the child was now insane. i lay still, i sald nothing; little i cared. presently a girl named bertha entered</p>
<p>to murmur the words: "he isn t found yet"; and from some words murmured in reply by mrs. wiseman, i</p>
<p>gathered that sir philip lister had disappeared. little i cared, i lay still and sullen, with closed lids. near noon</p>
<p>again came the news that the men seeking for sir philip lister could even yet discover no trace of him;</p>
<p>but at about live in the evening he was found dying in the hollow of the rock that lies behind</p>
<p>the cascade that they call "the ape," and was brought to the hall. very soon afterwards mrs. wiseman, who had</p>
<p>then left my side, flew in again to me with crying eyes, imploring me to try and go for a</p>
<p>moment to the dying man, who was hungering to have one sight of me; and i let her throw some</p>
<p>clothes over me, and was led by her to the death-bed. by this time i knew -- for mrs, wiseman</p>
<p>during the day had revealed it to me in a flood of tears -- that sir philip lister s mother</p>
<p>had too much listened to the chuckling cascade, and so had borne him the being he was -- a being</p>
<p>capable at any agitation of shedding his human nature to resume the nature of the brute, and hurling away human</p>
<p>raiment with his human nature in the murderous turbulence of his nocturnal revels -- he who in my eyes had</p>
<p>been so perfect in gentleness, so shy, so staid! but none the less i shuddered to the soul when he</p>
<p>touched my hand to pant at me through the death-ruckle rolling in his throat: "i have loved you well" --</p>
<p>a shudder which perhaps saved me from death or from madness, for i had lapsed that day into a mad</p>
<p>apathy. it was nearly night then, and the light in there was very dreary; but i could still see that</p>
<p>the hair which overgrew the ogre s frame was considerably more than an inch deep -- greenish, and gross as</p>
<p>the gorilla s. it clasped him round the throat and round the wrists in lines perfectly defined, like a perfect</p>
<p>coat of fur that he wore; and it did not thin, but continued no less thick where it abruptly ended</p>
<p>than everywhere else. but he had "loved me well," and i him now -- for if he had been perniciously</p>
<p>iealous, it was for love of me that he had been jealous; and in dying he looked into my eyes</p>
<p>with human eyes, kindly, mildly, looking "i have loved you well"; and when with his last strength he pointed to</p>
<p>where the pebble i had flung had sunk into his skull, then i lifted my voice and wept to god</p>
<p>because of him, and myself, and hargen hall and all, not caring any longer if my face was buried in</p>
<p>the horror of his hairy breast. and so he died, and huggins lister, and i was left alive. he goeth</p>
<p>after her. . . and knoweth not . . ." -- {from a diary} three days ago! by heaven, it</p>
<p>seems an age, but i am shaken -- my reason is debauched. a while since, i fell into a momentary</p>
<p>coma precisely resembling an attack of petit mal. "tombs, and worms, and epitaphs" -- that is my dream. at my</p>
<p>age, with my physique, to walk staggery, like a man stricken.-" but all that will pass: i must collect myself</p>
<p>-- my reason is debauched. three days ago! it seems an age! i sat on the floor before an old</p>
<p>cista full of letters. i lighted upon a packet of cosmo s. why, i had forgotten them! they are turning</p>
<p>sere! truly, i can no more call myself a old man. i sat reading, listlessly, rapt back by memory. to</p>
<p>muse is to be lost! of that evil habit i must wring the neck, or look to perish, once more</p>
<p>i threaded the mazy sphere-harmony of the minuet, reeled in the waltz, long pomps of candelabra, the noonday of the</p>
<p>bacchanal, about me. cosmo was the very tsar and maharaiah of the sybarites." the priap of the détraqués! in every</p>
<p>unexpected alcove of the roman villa was a couch, raised high, with necessary foot-stool, flanked and canopied with mirrors of</p>
<p>clarified gold. consumption fastened upon him; reclining at last at table, he could, till warmed, scarce lift the wine! his</p>
<p>eyes were like two fat glow-worms, coiled together! they seemed haloed with vaporous emanations of phosphorus! desperate, one could</p>
