<p>think my boss is going to say when i tell him my load of concrete has evaporated! yelled the concrete</p>
<p>truck driver. not my problem , yelled bull neck. go and get another load and this time don t lose</p>
<p>it!!! the poor concrete truck driver, bruised, shaken and by now speechless got back into his truck and drove off</p>
<p>to get another load of concrete. moron!! yelled bull neck as the concrete truck drove off. the insects had moved</p>
<p>well clear by now in case their laughter could be heard. that was a smart move pearl , said louie.</p>
<p>i hate to think what bull neck will say, let alone his boss, when they discover his truck cab is</p>
<p>full of concrete! i think , said pearl. we will leave it at that for now and come back again</p>
<p>tomorrow. i don t want to be around when bull neck finds out what we have done to his truck</p>
<p>. the next day the insects returned through the quartz about the same time in the morning, strangely enough bull</p>
<p>neck had another truck and his boss was with him this time! most of the concrete had been poured and</p>
<p>the pipe supports were now in place. this was a little disappointing to the insects. so far they hadn t</p>
<p>been able to stop the pro/"ect. with the concrete now poured, bull neck and fred proceeded to drill holes in</p>
<p>the rock that was obstructing the path of the pipeline. the drilled holes were to take the charges that would</p>
<p>be detonated and break up the rock for removal. when the pair had finished drilling the holes in the rock,</p>
<p>bull neck went off and got the "new" truck and brought in the charges that were to be inserted in</p>
<p>the holes. there were ten in all. detonating cables were carefully attached to the charges. the charges with detonating cables</p>
<p>attached were slid down into the drilled holes in the rock. once the charges were in place, bull neck carefully</p>
<p>checked everything once more. after yesterday we didn t want anything else going wrong, that was for sure! bull neck</p>
<p>moved his truck back out of harm s way then he and fred walked slowly back up the cleared access,</p>
<p>unreeling the detonating wire as they "went. this was all under the watchful eye of bull neck s boss. some</p>
<p>considerable distance away they set up the detonating plunger that would ultimately set the charges off. pearl, louie and lulu</p>
<p>had remembered from the community notice board in the village that the detonation time had been publicly advertised for 11.00</p>
<p>am, it was now 10.15 a.m. bull neck, fred and the boss now waited in their safe position for 11.00</p>
<p>am to arrive. every five minutes they announced over a loud speaker that detonation would be in so many minutes</p>
<p>and to please clear the area. quick , said pearl. we haven t got much time, follow me . the</p>
<p>insects went over to the rock to be detonated. pearl carefully pulled the ten charges back out of the rock</p>
<p>with the help of louie and lulu. once the charges were out of the rock and on the ground, pearl</p>
<p>said. louie and lulu, put five of them in through the front side window of bull neck s truck, make</p>
<p>sure the detonation lines stay connected. the remaining five i am going to put under some of the concrete pipe</p>
<p>supports . what mischief, it was hard to stop laughing. the three mischief makers heard in the distance, fifteen minutes</p>
<p>to blasting, please clear the area . they still had some time left. when the insects had finished the [ob</p>
<p>they took off and flew to where bull neck, his boss and fred were. five minutes to blasting, clear the</p>
<p>area , bull neck yelled into his hand held loud speaker. bull neck s boss turned to bull neck and</p>
<p>said. you had better not stuff it up this time mate or you will be toast! bull neck ignored his</p>
<p>boss and concentrated on the /"ob in hand. one minute to blasting, please clear the area , yelled bull neck.</p>
<p>a short time later bull neck counted down. ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one, contact! there</p>
<p>was an agonising pause then there was a huge explosion. the shock waves swished through the trees, scaring the birds,</p>
<p>animals and insects into absolute silence. some half minute later there was an echo from the distant hills, that should</p>
<p>do it boss , said bull neck smirking, let s go and see said bull neck s boss, the</p>
<p>insects followed close behind as the three men headed back expecting the rock to have been demolished. the men stopped</p>
<p>in their tracks. five of the pipe supports had been destroyed," two were up a tree! worst of all the</p>
<p>new truck, all that was left of it was the tray! the front end was scattered far and wide. my</p>
<p>truck! wailed the boss. bull neck s boss turned and socked bull neck in the face and shouted. you bloody</p>
<p>incompetent idiot, i can t believe it!!! first you fill one truck up with concrete then you blow up this</p>
<p>one. what are you bloody well going to do for your next trickt? i can t take any more! bull</p>
<p>neck s boss was shouting and wringing his hands. fred had taken off by this time; there was no way</p>
<p>he was ever going to come back. bull neck followed fred yelling. the place is spooked! well after that nobody</p>
<p>did come back! the pro/"ect was reconsidered by the council and the pipe was eventually laid under the road to</p>
<p>the village. this was /"ust as the villagers had originally wanted it. our three intrepid insects flew back to the</p>
<p>quartz wall at the bank and through to the tunnel. in the tunnel pearl turned and said. a iob well-done</p>
<p>you two! that was just incredible said louie and lulu together. you are a genius pearl . that</p>
<p>I"</p>
