<p>control. just as their fob as fernlanders was to make sure that didn t happen. the fernland men watched carefully</p>
<p>as an archer measured out powders from three different boxes and packed them into a short length of hollow bamboo.</p>
<p>they stood a few feet away to protect themselves from explosions and hilgard shouted out questions in the barburee tongue.</p>
<p>"he says the yellow powder is not dangerous," hilgard translated. smiles walked to the box that contained the yellow powder</p>
<p>and stuck his finger into the rank smelling substance. he sniffed it and coughed. "smells like somethin gone bad." hilgard</p>
<p>asked about the second box of black powder. "left over from fire? i m not sure what that means," hilgard</p>
<p>said, "but he says that one is not dangerous either." smiles moved to the second box and pinched a bit</p>
<p>between his fingers. "don t be settin something off," bear yelled to his friend. smiles brought the bit of black</p>
<p>powder over to bear. bear shrunk back a little. "ain t nothin but charcoal, ground up like. see?" smiles held</p>
<p>his fingers out for bear s inspection. bear sniffed it and ground a bit into a finer powder with his</p>
<p>fingers. "he s right. tis charcoal." the others gathered around and agreed, in turnit was only charcoal. "the last box</p>
<p>holds the troublemaker," hilgard said, after speaking to the archer. "he says it sometimes explodes on its own." they looked</p>
<p>at the white powder in the third box from a distance. smiles started to walk toward it. "are ya crazy?"</p>
<p>bear shouted. "did ya not hear what the man said?" smiles shrugged and turned back to his friends. "how we</p>
<p>gonna fix them bad arrows if we don t take a look see?" they saw that the archer had finished</p>
<p>packing and wicking his bamboo tube and was now in the process of attaching it to a heavy arrow. he</p>
<p>turned to sight in on a sheep s skull at the end of the field. then he lowered the arrow,</p>
<p>lit the wick with a candle and quickly let the arrow fly. the arrow hit its mark and the sheep</p>
<p>s skull exploded. a cheer went up from his fellow archers. muller ran down the field and gathered up the</p>
<p>fragments of bone he could find. he brought these few burnt fragments back to show to the other fernland men.</p>
<p>"this is incredible. i could hardly find a piece bigger than my thumb. we have to take some of those</p>
<p>powders back to fernland." "by we, i m hopin ya mean you," bear stood with his hands on his hips.</p>
<p>"i ll not be carryin it nor comin near him what is." muller glared contemptuously at bear, then turned to</p>
<p>hilgard. "we need to find out where they get the yellow and white powders. the charcoal is no problem." they</p>
<p>watched as more archers packed tubes with measured portions of the three powderstwo parts yellow, three parts black and fifteen</p>
<p>parts white. the archers seemed encouraged by the success of the sheep s skull explosion. a cloud of powder hung</p>
<p>in the air as they worked. several men got off successful shots, then a close call occurred as a tube</p>
<p>exploded Just after an arrow was released. take moved a little closer to watch as an archer finished packing his</p>
<p>tube with powders, then pressed wax into both ends to seal it. he stuck a thin stick through the soft</p>
<p>wax to form a wick. take stepped back as the archer began to tie the tube to an arrow. take</p>
<p>shook his head as he returned to his group of friends. "maybe it is bad magic. it looks like chance</p>
<p>whether it explodes when the wick burns through like it s supposed to or whether it blows up before the</p>
<p>flame makes contact." "you would think they would be more afraid then they seem to be," hilgard said. muller shook</p>
<p>his head. "the rewards when it works are too great. they have to chance it and to do that, they</p>
<p>have to practice." "i can t see fernland s archers wantin ta chance it," bear said. muller glared at bear</p>
<p>for the second time. "if you re so worried about your safety why don t you go wait with the</p>
<p>women?" bear glared back at muller, then his glare turned into a mean smile. "why don t i /ust do</p>
<p>that." what bout you then smiles, ya comin with me to wait with the women folk?" smiles shrugged and looked</p>
<p>sheepishly at his friends. "i spose i d best." bear was grateful when his friend ioined him. they headed back</p>
<p>to the city of tents. when they were out of hearing range bear turned to smiles. "the spy s just</p>
<p>mad cause he knows i m right. nobody in fernland is stupid enough ta be messin with arrows what explode</p>
<p>any time they feel like it." "bet yer right there. what ya make of it? why s a one explode</p>
<p>ahead a time and an a tother don t?" "i m guessin once them three powders get together they re</p>
<p>ready ta blow an all kinds a things could set em off. like maybe shakin or somethin . but i</p>
<p>don t see no good comin from tryin to find out." when they reached twenty quivers tent, the two little</p>
<p>grand daughters ran out to meet them. their hands were covered with flour. "long as we re sent ta keep</p>
<p>the women folk company, what say we show them how a proper sweet pastry s made?" bear asked. "i got</p>
<p>a bit of a taste fer one." "now yer talkin my language." smiles began rolling up his sleeves. the two</p>
<p>men entered the tent, much to the delight of the little girls. with gestures toward the flour, the wood fire</p>
<p>and themselves, they let the women know they meant to cook. the women looked surprised but laughed among themselves and</p>
<p>stood back to watch. bear located the ingredients he neededbarley flour, oil, goat s milk, honey and some dried</p>
