<p>My son, despise not the chastening of the Lord ," neither be weary of his correction : for whom the</p>
<p>Lord loveth he correcteth ." even as a father the son in whom he delighteth. Happy is the man that</p>
<p>findeth wisdom, and the man that getteth understanding : for the merchandise of it is better than the merchandise of</p>
<p>silver, and the gain thereof than fine gold. She is more precious than rubies : and all the things thou</p>
<p>canst desire are not to be compared unto her. Length of days is in her right hand ; and in</p>
<p>her left hand riches and honor. Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace. She is</p>
<p>a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her : and happy is every one that retaineth her.</p>

<p>: keep sound wisdom and discretion : so shall they be life unto thy soul, and grace to thy neck.</p>
<p>Then shalt thou Walk in thy way safely, and thy foot shall not stumble. when thou liest down, thou shalt</p>
<p>not be afraid : yea, thou shalt lie down, and thy sleep shall be sweet. Be not afraid of sudden</p>
<p>fear, neither of the desolation of the wicked, when it cometh. For the Lord shall be thy confidence, and shall</p>
<p>keep thy foot from being taken. withhold not good from them to whom it is due, when it is in</p>
<p>the power of thine hand to do it. Say not unto thy neighbor, Go, and come again, and tomorrow I</p>
<p>will give ," when thou hast it by thee. Devise not evil against thy neighbor, seeing he dwelleth securely by</p>
<p>thee. Strive not with a man without cause, if he have done thee no harm. Envy thou not the oppressor,</p>
<p>and choose none of his ways. For the froward is abomination to the Lord : but his secret is with</p>
<p>the righteous. The curse of the Lord is in the house of the wicked : but he blesseth the habitation</p>
<p>of the just. Surely he scorneth the scorners : but he giveth grace unto the lowly. The wise shall inherit</p>
<p>glory : but shame shall be the promotion of fools. 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 2I 28 2I</p>

<p>a father, and attend to know understanding. For I give you good doctrine, forsake ye not my law. For "I</p>
<p>was my father s son, tender and only beloved in the sight of my mother. He taught me also, and</p>
<p>said unto me, Let thine heart retain my words : keep my commandments, and live. Get wisdom, get understanding :</p>
<p>forget it not ; neither decline from the words of my mouth. Forsake her not, and she shall preserve thee</p>
<p>." love her, and she shall keep thee. wisdom is the principal thing ; therefore get wisdom : and with</p>
<p>all thy getting get understanding. Exalt her, and she shall promote thee : she shall bring thee to honor, when</p>
<p>thou dost embrace her. She shall give to thine head an ornament of grace : a crown of glory shall</p>
<p>she deliver to thee. Hear, O my son, and receive my sayings ." and the years of thy life shall</p>
<p>be many. "I have taught thee in the way of wisdom ; I have led thee in right paths. when</p>
<p>thou goest, thy steps shall not be straitened I and when thou runnest, thou shalt not stumble. Take fast hold</p>
<p>of instruction ." let her not go : keep her ," for she is thy life. Enter not into the</p>
<p>path of the wicked, and go not in the way of evil men. 1 2 3 4 5 6 I</p>

<p>cause some to fall. For they eat the bread of wickedness, and drink the wine of violence. But the path</p>
<p>of the just is as the shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day. The way of</p>
<p>the wicked is as darkness : they know not at what they stumble. My son, attend to my words ,"</p>
<p>incline thine ear unto my sayings. Let them not depart from thine eyes ; keep them in the midst of</p>
<p>thine heart. For they are life unto those that find them, and health to all their flesh. Keep thy heart</p>
<p>with all diligence I for out of it are the issues of life. Put away from thee a froward mouth,</p>
<p>and perverse lips put far from thee. Let thine eyes look right on, and let thine eyelids look straight before</p>
<p>thee. Ponder the path of thy feet, and let all thy ways be established. Turn not to the right hand</p>
<p>nor to the left ." remove thy foot from evil. 5 warning against Unchastity My son, attend unto my wisdom,</p>
<p>and bow thine ear to my understanding ." that thou mayest regard discretion, and that thy lips may keep knowledge.</p>

<p>Hear me now therefore, 0 ye children, and depart not from the words of my mouth. Remove thy way far</p>
