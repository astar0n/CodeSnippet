<p>If it be a house dog, the Dru/" Nasu rushes forth, O Spitama Zarathushtralshe goes as far as the seventh</p>
<p>and defiles the six. I If it be a Vohunazga dog, the Dru/" Nasu rushes forth, O Spitama Zarathushtra!she goes</p>
<p>as far as the sixth and defiles the five. If it be a Tauruna dog, the Dru/" Nasu rushes forth,</p>
<p>0 Spitama Zarathushtra! she goes as far as the fifth and defiles the four. . . . Those clothes shall</p>
<p>serve for their coverings and for their sheets. . . . III. 10 O Maker of the material world, thou</p>
<p>Holy One! what part of his bedding and pillow does the Dru/" Nasu defile with corruption,infection, and pollution? 11 Ahura</p>
<p>Mazda answered: The Dru/" Nasu defiles with corruption,infection, and pollution the upper sheet and the inner garment. 12 O Maker</p>
<p>of the material World, thou Holy One! Can that garment be made clean, 0 holy Ahura Mazda! that has been</p>
<p>touched by the carcass of a dog or the corpse of a man? 13 Ahura Mazda answered: It can, 0</p>
<p>holy Zarathushtra! How so? If there be on the garment seed, or blood, or dirt, or vomit,the worshippers of Mazda</p>
<p>shall rend it to pieces, and bury it under the ground. I4 8ut if there be no seed [on the</p>
<p>garment], nor blood, nor dirt, nor vomit, then the worshippers of Mazda shall wash it with gomez. I5 If it</p>
<p>be leather, they shall wash it with gomez three times,they shall rub it with earth three times, they shall wash</p>
<p>it with water three times, and afterwards they shall expose it to the air for three months at the window</p>
<p>of the house. If it be woven cloth, they shall wash it with gomez six times,they shall rub it with</p>
<p>earth six times, they shall wash it with water six times, and afterwards they shall expose it to the air</p>
<p>for six months at the window of the house. 16 The spring named Ardvi Sura, O Spitama Zarathushtra! that spring</p>
<p>of mine, purifies the seed of males, the womb of females,the milk of females. 1I O Maker of the material</p>
<p>world, thou Holy One! can those clothes,when once washed and cleansed, ever be used either by a Zaotar,or by a</p>
<p>Havanan, or by an Atare-vakhsha, or by .I Fargard I : Purity laws a Frabaretar, or by an Abered, or</p>
<p>by an Asnatar, or by a Rathwishkar, or by a Sraosha-varez,or by any priest, warrior, or husbandman? 18 Ahura Mazda</p>
<p>answered: Never can those clothes, even when washed and cleansed, be used either by a Zaotar, or by a Havanan,</p>
<p>or by an Atare-vakhsha, or by a Frabaretar, or by an Abered, or by an Asnatar, or by a Rathwishkar,</p>
<p>or by a Sraosha-varez, or by any priest, warrior, or husbandman. 1I But if there be in a Mazdean house</p>
<p>a woman who is in her sickness, or a man who has become unfit for work, and who must sit</p>
<p>in the place of infirmity, those clothes shall serve for their coverings and for their sheets, until they can withdraw</p>
<p>their hands for prayer. 2:? Ahura Mazda, indeed, does not allow us to waste anything of value that we may</p>
<p>have, not even so much as an Asperena s weight of thread, not even so much as a maid lets</p>
<p>fall in spinning. 21 whosoever throws any clothing on a dead body, even so much as a maid lets fall</p>
<p>in spinning, is not a pious man whilst "!live,nor shall he, when dead, have a place in Paradise. 22 He</p>
<p>makes himself a viaticum unto the world of the wicked,into that world, made of darkness, the offspring of darkness,which is</p>
<p>Darkness self. To that world, to the world of Hell,you are delivered by your own doings, by your own religion,</p>
<p>0 sinners! IV. 23 O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! Can he be clean again who has</p>
<p>eaten of the carcass of a dog or of the corpse of a man? 24 Ahura Mazda answered: He cannot,</p>
<p>O holy Zarathushtra! His burrow shall be dug out, his heart shall be torn out, his bright eyes shall be</p>
<p>put out; the Dru/" Nasu falls upon him, takes hold of him even to the end of the nails, and</p>
<p>he is unclean thenceforth,for ever and ever. V. 25 O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! Can he</p>
<p>be clean again, 0 holy Ahura Mazda! who has brought a corpse with filth into the waters, or unto the</p>
<p>fire, and made either unclean? 26 Ahura Mazda answered: He cannot, O holy Zarathushtra! Those wicked ones it is, those</p>
<p>? Fargard I : Purity laws Nasu-cutters, that most increase spiders and locusts; those wicked ones it is, those Nasu-cutters,</p>
<p>that most increase the grass-destroying drought. 2I Those wicked ones it is, those Nasu-cutters, that increase most the power of</p>
<p>the winter, produced by the fiends, the cattle-killing,thick- snowing, overflowing, the piercing, fierce, mischievous winter, Upon them comes and rushes</p>
<p>the Dru/" Nasu she takes hold of them even to the end of the nails, and they are unclean, thenceforth,for</p>
<p>ever and ever. VI. 28 O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! Can the wood be made clean,</p>
<p>0 holy Ahura Mazda! whereunto Nasu has been brought from a dead dog, or from a dead man? 2I Ahura</p>
<p>Mazda answered: It can, 0 holy Zarathushtra! How so? "if the Nasu has not yet been expelled by the corpse-eating</p>
<p>dogs, or by the corpse-eating birds, they shall lay down, apart on the ground, all the wood on a Vitasti</p>
<p>a all around, if the wood be dry; on a Frarathni all around, if it be wet," then they shall</p>
<p>sprinkle it once over with water, and it shall be clean. 30 But if the Nasu has already been expelled</p>
<p>by the corpse-eating dogs, or by the corpse-eating birds, they shall lay down, apart on the ground, all the wood</p>
<p>on a Frarathni all around, if the wood be dry; on a Frabazu all around, if it be wet; then</p>
<p>they shall sprinkle it once over with water, and it shall be clean. 3I Thus much of the wood around</p>
<p>the dead shall they lay down, apart on the ground, according as the wood is dry or wet;as it is</p>
<p>hard or soft," they shall sprinkle it once over with water,and it shall be clean. 32 O Maker of the</p>
<p>material world, thou Holy One! Can the corn or the fodder be made clean O holy Ahura Mazda! whereunto Nasu</p>
<p>has been brought from a dead dog, or from a dead man? 33 Ahura Mazda answered: It can, 0</p>
