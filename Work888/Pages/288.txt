<p>i must tell you because i fear that if i do not, i shall place your life in great peril."</p>
<p>the son urgently pressed, "da, what is it?" weighing the difficulty in his heart, the father said, "before i tell</p>
<p>you, understand the meaning of the word love. remember it, feel it, hold it, give it, and express it. most</p>
<p>importantly, never lose sight of it. love is what brought you into this world. love is what makes people strive</p>
<p>onward, and love is what makes people live. understand there will come a time when the only thing left to</p>
<p>fight for is love, and it will be love that shall overcome all." the son nodded innocently. clenching his son</p>
<p>s hand, the father looked at him with grave concern. "yesterday an angel of grace appeared to me while i</p>
<p>was plowing the field, and she said unto me that i must take my firstborn son regularly to the temple</p>
<p>to pray in order that it may remind you of where the seed of love is born from. for one</p>
<p>day, you will deny god s love, and because of it, you shall come to face a great many tribulations."</p>
<p>the son iumped to his feet, inquiring with panic in his trembling voice, "da, am i at harm? why me?</p>
<p>tell me now! what have i done to deserve this?" the father stood to embrace his son in his thick</p>
<p>arms and replied comfortingly, "now, now, lad. everything will be alright." yet the son, refusing such consolation, pushed away from</p>
<p>his father, shouting, "no, everything is not!" as the son stared teary eyed into the crackling flames, the father explained,</p>
<p>"do you understand why the angel appeared unto me? the angel came in an effort to protect you." "how will</p>
<p>i be protected if i am destined to deny him anyways?" the father was at a loss for words. there</p>
<p>was no explanation, no logic to offer-only Words of sorrow. "for that, i do not know. i am truly sorry."</p>
<p>with steady steps, the father met his son before the fire and hugged him from behind as they both stood</p>
<p>in wordless thought, the father s husky voice broke the silence. "what does our faith tell us about handling uncertainty?</p>
<p>we are taught that we should place our unyielding trust in god in order for him to make everything right."</p>
<p>the son did not respond but remained quietly in his father s embrace. "the angel also said unto me that</p>
<p>you do not walk this iourney alone, for you shall soon come to meet your spiritual brother." turning around, the</p>
<p>son looked up to his father, meeting his unusually bright smile. the father exclaimed, "he will be your best friend."</p>
<p>"really?" wiping away the tears from his son s cheek, he said, "yes!" the son s lips parted in a</p>
<p>slow approaching grin. the father embraced his son once again. "i love you." "i love you too, da." as the</p>
<p>memory began to fade away, the father whispered words that lingered in his son s ear, "when you return, go</p>
<p>to your brother, for he is uncertain of your fate." liviulé flinched as his eyes opened wide with panic. frantically,</p>
<p>he jostled around on his cot trying to figure out where he was, pleading, "where am i?" as liviulé 5</p>
<p>eyes began to focus, damyen chuckled. "bacilly. why-have you forgotten?" liviulé pushed a heavy blanket aside as his lungs mildly</p>
<p>hyperventilated. his tunic was soaked with sweat, and in his anger, he struggled to remove it. after pulling the tunic</p>
<p>over his head, he thrashed it far across the room. bare-chested and burning up, liviulé dropped back down on the</p>
<p>bed, wiping beads of sweat from his forehead and grumbling, "this was the first night in many nights that i</p>
<p>was finally able to sleep, and this is how god repays me-by bringing up chilling memories of my past." grabbing</p>
<p>his boots and sitting down on the cot across from his distraught friend, damyen asked, "did you have that dream</p>
<p>about your father again?" "yes!" liviulé shook his head in disbelief and added, "no matter what, i will never forget</p>
<p>that night and what he said to me, particularly about love and my own demise. it just tears at my</p>
<p>soul, damyen. i am torn knowing that i will deny god!" damyen slid his right foot into his boot. "i</p>
<p>think we have been torn in our own ways. in my case, i am reminded of the necklace that my</p>
<p>ex-girlfriend, mallelin of mantua, continued to wear after i broke her heart." "you never quite got over that." "never." "i</p>
<p>remember the origins of that necklace and how it came into her possession," liviulé stated. "it all began when she</p>
<p>fell terribly ill and no one, not even the best physicians or medicinals, could cure her." "and you did what</p>
<p>you had to do." "agreed." the conversation was beginning to brighten liviule s spirit, and he agreed, "so that night</p>
<p>i secretly came to her bedside while she was asleep bringing holy oil from the relics of saint ioan. 4""</p>
<p>then dabbed my fingers with it and blessed her on the forehead while saying the healing prayer. when i was</p>
<p>finished, i placed the holy oil in the palm of her hand and then i left." as damyen finished putting</p>
<p>on his left boot, he continued the conversation where liviulé left off, saying, "and that was the last time any</p>
<p>of us had either seen or heard from her,,,until months later, when we discovered that mallelin was miraculously healed," damyen</p>
<p>exhaled a chuckle. "her parents were inviting everyone over for a grand celebration." then damyen s voice grew hushed. "i</p>
<p>remember the very first time i saw her that night. she was so beautiful, so angelic. she was wearing a</p>
<p>glimmering gown that matched her green eyes, and her ash-blond hair brushed the crevice of her lower back. her thin</p>
<p>lips gave way to that full smile of hers. and who could forget her quirkiness and how she does</p>
