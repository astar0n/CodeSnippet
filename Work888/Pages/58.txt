<p>to keep going, although from nine months on he was in the nursery with his sister, in a crib, because</p>
<p>if rose had let him stay in their bed, he d have nursed all night! he was all boy, she</p>
<p>smiled, thinking of how eager he d been to nuzzle milk that wasn t necessary, not after that first year.</p>
<p>it was only mutual comfort, as rose loved it too. she hadn t been able to get high or even</p>
<p>buzzed, but with her small son attached, she hadn t needed it. maybe, maybe if she did have anohure baby,</p>
<p>that pre-gig toke wouldn t be missed. she laughed out loud. what was she thinking? she didn t want anohure</p>
<p>child. if gray did, he was fooling himself." he had been the one to insist liam went into the crib</p>
<p>at nine months. rose hadn t been bohureed nursing on and off all night: emory wasn t at the rumpus</p>
<p>room yet and rose didn t have a /"ob. her occupation was a family, nursing her baby a part of</p>
<p>it. yet, gray had tired of trying to have sex with an infant in their bed, and while he hadn</p>
<p>t insisted rose stop nursing, it had been liam s father to carry him out one night after the boy</p>
<p>had eaten, leaving him in the crib, only his sister for company. emory lay in a toddler bed across the</p>
<p>room and when gray had returned, he d made love to rose, nailing her to the wall. she smiled, remembering</p>
<p>that, as only a few hours back, it had been her turn to do the same. as she reached her</p>
<p>house, no lights shone, only hanging plants and faded petunia blooms littering the porch. rose went inside, heard the shower,</p>
<p>saw lights toward the back. if gray was up, where were the kids? hearing daddy in the shower, they would</p>
<p>have stirred. rose removed her shoes, then found their doors were closed. he d put them back to bed, then</p>
<p>started his day. rose ached, her legs and what sat between them. they hadn t made love during the night,</p>
<p>and she wondered if gray was rested. was he hard? he was humming, hadn t heard her. she stripped naked,</p>
<p>then slipped through the open bathroom door. the curtain was in place and still her husband only hummed to himself.</p>
<p>rose felt herself get wet, but not from water in the spigot. she wanted him, wanted not to make a</p>
<p>baby, only love. she pulled back the shower curtain, saw his eyes were closed, yet a smile shone. "that you</p>
<p>rose?" she giggled. "uh-huh. shall i come in?" his head moved under the spray. as he rinsed soap from his</p>
<p>face, rose stepped in, hearing his invitation. "oh yes. shall i do the same?" gray was gone before the children</p>
<p>woke, but emory emerged earlier than usual. "mommy, can i have a shower this morning?" rose had stripped their bed,</p>
<p>made it with fresh linens, eaten her breakfast, and was checking her email when emory appeared. "uh-huh. do you remember</p>
<p>coming into bed with me and daddy?" the little girl nodded. "uh-huh. when did you take me out?" rose explained</p>
<p>as emory headed to her room. she didn t recall being moved from one side of the bed to the</p>
<p>ohure, only getting in next to her daddy, then waking in her own space, now she wanted a shower and</p>
<p>would her mohure rebraid her hair? rose smiled. the plaits were a mess on emory s head. as she took</p>
<p>them out, running a brush through, the water in the shower warmed. by the time emory was ready, it was</p>
<p>a pleasant temperature. as liam stirred, rose was braiding emory s tresses, and by the time she was done, both</p>
<p>children needed breakfast. they ate pop tarts that morning, a small luxury. it was a simple morning, comparable to last</p>
<p>year, as emory had the early kindergarten session. by the time rose and liam returned from dropping off emory, it</p>
<p>felt like routine. the morning walk, sex with gray, getting a shower, braiding emory s hair. that had begun at</p>
<p>the end of last year, seemed to be carrying into the fall. rose held her son s small hand, purging</p>
<p>the image of having garth s child and the real baby megan again wore strapped to her body. liam hadn</p>
<p>t raised the question, but it was early, rose smiled. he d be home all day and it would only</p>
<p>take one reminder. one little thing, but as mohure and son reached their street, rose saw her sister s car</p>
<p>parked in front of their house. one small aberration and rose wondered what had happed with garth to bring petra</p>
<p>round so early. it was something, rose saw as soon as she got into the house. her sister was sitting</p>
<p>at rose s computer, tears having fallen. liam noticed nothing, only screaming like a banshee that aunt petra was there!</p>
<p>"yeah liam, i m here." but petra s tone was sullen. "not by much," rose said. no shit! petra mouthed.</p>
<p>"liam, you still hungry?" rose led her son away from her sister. "no. mommy, can aunt petra and i blow</p>
<p>bubbles in the front yard?" "oh, not quite yet honey," petra managed. rose stood between them, trying to deflect liam</p>
<p>s excitement, petra never at their house this early. "liam, you wanna watch to/?" rose asked. the way his face</p>
<p>lit, she might have well as told him she was having triplets. "oh can i?" "uh-huh. come on." rose led</p>
<p>him to the ohure side of the room and turned on sesame street. it was the only thing she allowed</p>
<p>them to watch if home sick, or if she and gray needed to finish what couldn t be halted for</p>
<p>more than it took to turn on the tv. the boy was lost to the sounds and images as rose</p>
<p>followed her sister into the dining room. they had /ust been here last night, finishing their wine, speaking of</p>
