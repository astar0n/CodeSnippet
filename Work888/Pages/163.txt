<p>moon. however, these powers were flawed. they were not constant but a temporary power, since lightning and thunder only came</p>
<p>during a storm, and the sun and moon were limited by day or night. therefore, these earliest deserters failed and</p>
<p>crawled back to their holy father begging for his mercy. then millennia later when the children became wiser, another group</p>
<p>of children deserted their holy father to become their own gods, but this time they decided to choose powers related</p>
<p>to feelings. some children chose happiness, sadness, anger, ioy, laughter, and sorrow; however, no matter how much power they could</p>
<p>garner, none came close to their father s power of love. hence, that is why our holy father is also</p>
<p>called the god of love." the lads nodded enthusiastically. emeral said, "nonetheless, there did come a child that was most</p>
<p>envious and desirous of his holy father. so when the time came, he ran away in search of discovering a</p>
<p>power that would match his father s. and as a lesson to his son, god abandoned him in an effort</p>
<p>for him to fail so that he may return home begging for mercy; however, something most unfortunate occurred. being the</p>
<p>smartest and most gifted of all his children, this child of god took up fﬁelings of hate. as he prayed</p>
<p>inwardly, all the while reviling his father s name, his children, and everything that he created, the son s heart</p>
<p>and soul began to blacken. at last, when he cursed all that he was, the world trembled with great horror,</p>
<p>for this child of god bore a new power that equaled the power of love. his name is raul, and</p>
<p>his power is fear." the words struck a particular chord with damyen. "is that why you stormed out of my</p>
<p>room in port pleasant because saint seraphim s passage may actually be speaking to god s love and raul s</p>
<p>fear?" "possibly. that is why i am even more concerned about claudias vision. but as i was saying,,_" the lads</p>
<p>strode alongside emeral with open ears as he continued, "after raul created this extraordinary new power, he decided to travel</p>
<p>to each of the five kingdoms and impregnate this newfound fear into the souls of every man. he did this</p>
<p>not only to increase his power but also to rally an army against the god of love. once raul was</p>
<p>accepted into their communities and earned their trust, he went to work at distorting their beliefs in god. he told</p>
<p>them that the god of love resided on top of a mountain surrounded by a city of gold and that</p>
<p>he had become selfish and greedy. he said that although he claimed to rule over all people and lands, he</p>
<p>did not care for anyone but his chosen who lived luxuriously inside his walled city. raul posed a convincing argument</p>
<p>to the tribes that if the god of love were indeed true and just, why did he help some but</p>
<p>not others? and why did he treat the <chosen:- lavishly instead of providing for all his people equally?" the three</p>
<p>listeners mumbled their agreement. "when raul succeeded at placing the communities at odds with one another, he gathered up the</p>
<p>little fear that was beginning to root in their hearts and created a furious storm that destroyed their villages. by</p>
<p>the following dusk, he had increased the amount of fear placed in their hearts tenfold. he then con/"ured up a</p>
<p>second storm more furious than the first. this vicious cycle repeated itself for several months until the tribesmen sought raul</p>
<p>for advice. raul advised that they seek the god of love s help. so the tribesmen agreed and packed up</p>
<p>their belongings and followed raul into the desert. as they traveled to the <<holy> <city:—:—, raul ensured the storm followed</p>
<p>closely behind. but when the five tribes reached the gates full of fear, god s chosen refused to let them</p>
<p>enter due to their impurity. this response infuriated them so much that the five kingdoms decided to unite and wage</p>
<p>war against the god of love." damyen barely held back a gasp. "it was then that the five kingdoms attacked</p>
<p>theoria and breached the gates. they fought their way towards the temple mount striking down anyone who stood in there</p>
<p>way; however, not one of god s <chosen:- fought back. and before any of them were struck down, they vanished</p>
<p>into thin air-until their return at the end times. by sundown, the five kingdoms had reached the foot of the</p>
<p>mountain, and there they joined raul in reviling the god of love s name. it was in that moment when</p>
<p>raul raised himself up before the five tribes and commanded their worship, seeing the divinity within him, the five tribes</p>
<p>bowed to their new god out of fear, and raul ascended the mountain to unseat the holy father." emeral gripped</p>
<p>his beard, and his eyes glazed over as if the event played on before him. "but what raul did next</p>
<p>would come to haunt his eternal existence. when raul reached the summit, he dashed off across the courtyard, rushed up</p>
<p>the steps past the pillars, and lunged into the god of love s holy temple. the mountain trembled, and the</p>
<p>god of love s uncreated light cast itself in every direction. then the people from the five kingdoms realized the</p>
<p>evil they had committed and dropped to their knees begging the god of love for mercy. and indeed the god</p>
<p>of love was merciful; he did not strike them down, but instead he gave them a second chance. it is</p>
<p>written in our holy book of credintza that this second chance would be much harder then the first because man</p>
<p>now had to work tirelessly to earn god s favor. if you lived a good life according to his new</p>
<p>covenant, then you would /oin the god of love in his newly created kingdom, in the heavens, which represents eternal</p>
<p>life. it is not an earthly kingdom; thus, the people chose not an earthly number. seven represents wholeness; hence,</p>
