<p>severe, but a captain must be a captain and a crew must be responsible for their activities. the experience of</p>
<p>the old ocean voyages has shown that a lenient captain was even worse than an overly strict captain. i think</p>
<p>that this captain is a gem." gabriel dead? the thought of it brought anna s rampant thoughts to a raging</p>
<p>halt. she struggled for internal control and found it with the barest rein on her emotions. "there s no need</p>
<p>for that," aurore called to her. "no need at all." "and meg?" she called back. "you killed her, too?" aurore</p>
<p>was silent for a moment. "it s so interesting about bloodlines here. the strongest ones are able to do the</p>
<p>most. the strongest ones become elders and protectors." a brief silence followed that, and then she added, "despite that neither</p>
<p>of my sons could ever find their way down here without a map. like you can." the photograph arette had</p>
<p>kept in the book came back to anna s mind. she had thought it a photograph of gaspard benoit. but</p>
<p>she hadn t accounted for the simple issue of time. the photograph was at least twenty-four years old and gaspard</p>
<p>would have been a child. it wasn t a picture of the son, but of the father, of the man</p>
<p>that arette had secretly loved, a younger sebastien. "sebastien was my mother s lover." "ah, oui. apparently she was too</p>
<p>much for sebastien to resist." she paused. "arette had a little tingle of the gift. i think maybe her family</p>
<p>might have had a distant relative to us. some great-granny perhaps." "Jesus christ!" anna swore. "did you have to kill</p>
<p>her, too?" aurore s silence was telling. "it was the only way to protect the family. arette liked to talk</p>
<p>to people. she was a friendly one. and they liked to talk to her. some outsiders can be like that,</p>
<p>like your friend in new orleans. but arette was curious about the mine. and she found her way down her,</p>
<p>just like you. what she discovered in this room caused her to take her unborn child and flee to some</p>
<p>far off place. but i had known of her presence. i asked gautier about her but he simply said she</p>
<p>was gone. when arette came back, several people saw her and recognized her as she made her way to her</p>
<p>husband s home. she didn t know that word tends to get around." there was a significant pause, "it had</p>
<p>to be done and gautier would never betray us. we didn t know about the child. about you. gautier must</p>
<p>have found you inside arette s car and it was he who took you away. took you away to protect</p>
<p>you from me." her voice seemed to be coming closer. anna realized aurore was stalling her while she searched for</p>
<p>her. the gift wasn t like radar unless anna chose to tell her where she was. she began to low</p>
<p>crawl through the vehicles and hunks of machinery, trying to work her way around to the other side of the</p>
<p>room where the main opening was located. feeling her way with her hands, she hoped that she wouldn t slice</p>
<p>some of her flesh wide open with a rusted piece of metal. keeping the glow of aurore s light on</p>
<p>her right side, she moved cautiously. "i think maybe you ve got me wrong, child. best to come clean with</p>
<p>you and hope blood runs true in your veins. i forgave sebastien for the slight of your mother years ago,</p>
<p>but even he wasn t sure if You should be privy to every little secret the family possesses." what are</p>
<p>you saying, aurore? you don t intend to kill me like you did all of them." she felt the bumper</p>
<p>of a car and wondered whom it had belonged to and what isolated, innocent act of being in the wrong</p>
<p>place at the wrong time they had committed. i don t want to kill you. not unless i have to.</p>
<p>stand up, anna. show me you trust me. it was the same voice in her mind that had warned her</p>
<p>that she would be iudged, iudged like gautier debou. "oh, god," she said. "you killed him, too? and if i</p>
<p>hadn t come along, his body would have vanished into the mine, as well?" "he kept sebastien s child away</p>
<p>from me, away from the family," aurore snarled. "he and that bitch of a woman, meg theriot. she wasn t</p>
<p>one of us. not really. she only had a smattering of the gift and far too greedy to suit anyone."</p>
<p>"what did meg have to do with it?" -she helped your mother run from the family, taking you with her.</p>
<p>gautier wanted to protect you. he knew that..." "what? gautier knew what." anna kept moving. the light was almost to</p>
<p>the peterbilt truck now. aurore didn t know where anna was, but if she kept moving she might be able</p>
<p>to outsmart the older woman. outrun her, too. she had marked every passage. aurore wouldn t know where anna was</p>
<p>going until she had fled. there were too many tunnels for aurore or his sons if they were there as</p>
<p>well. "as sebastien s child, with the amount of power you have, you become the next guardian. not gaspard. not</p>
<p>raoul. neither have the right gifts. it was always yours. the elders knew that you would do this. we all</p>
<p>knew." anna was instantly outraged. "you mean i m supposed to be some kind of official assassin for the family,</p>
<p>taking care of problems like the ones that fill this cave?" she paused. "you ve got a helluva thing up</p>
<p>on the mafia. casting huge shadows that move like monsters." what do you do with the bodies? feed them to</p>
<p>gouion?" "the outsiders have ruined you," aurore said sadly. her voice echoed weirdly over the chamber and anna knew that</p>
<p>she was almost to the opposite side. she barked her shin on an old conveyer belt and held the</p>
