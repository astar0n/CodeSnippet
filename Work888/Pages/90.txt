<p>head again. minutes later, elizabeth approached the front door, wondering what could be so urgent. all sorts of thoughts swirled</p>
<p>through her mind, the worst of them that iamie had died and that her sister needed her. but if evelyn</p>
<p>was grieving, elizabeth would sense that, and she didn t feel any sorrow from evelyn at the moment. /"ust as</p>
<p>she was about to step up to the door, maureen pulled it open. "there you are! we didn t know</p>
<p>where you were!" she exclaimed, grabbing elizabeth s hand and pulling her unceremoniously into the entry hall. elizabeth almost tripped</p>
<p>on the threshold but caught herself with a hand on the door/"amb. evelyn was standing in the hallway too, all</p>
<p>pretty in her yellow bodice and bronzy skirt, an embroidered cobweb linen collar around her neck and a lace veil</p>
<p>covering her head and flowing down past her shoulders. her face was all aglow, her cheeks pink with excitement, her</p>
<p>smile full of toy. all elizabeth could do was stare. she stared at maureen, who she noticed was looking as</p>
<p>lovely as ever; and she stared at evelyn, wondering what was going on. but seeing the veil... did that mean...."</p>
<p>she opened her mouth to ask the obvious question, but maureen continued to talk excitedly. "let me take your cloak</p>
<p>and then i have a veil for you too." "we re getting married right now!" evelyn said in an exhilarated</p>
<p>whisper. "right now?" elizabeth asked. she had not expected this. as she had passed people during her walk and exchanged</p>
<p>greetings with them, no one had given her any indication that the weddings would be held this morning. the talk</p>
<p>had been about iamie and his relapse and how awful the disease was. evelyn nodded her head vigorously. "but..." elizabeth</p>
<p>started to protest. her feet were still wet and cold and the hem of her skirt soaked through. she wasn</p>
<p>t properly dressed or prepared. "yes, right now." maureen answered, directly in front of elizabeth. she had hung up elizabeth</p>
<p>s cloak and had returned with the veil. first she smoothed elizabeth s hair, then with great care she draped</p>
<p>the lace over elizabeth s head and secured it with a silver bodkin. elizabeth fingered the beautiful needlepoint lace, then</p>
<p>looked down at her ordinary clothes and suddenly felt sad. she had always daydreamed that on her wedding day she</p>
<p>would wear a new gown in ivory silk damask with valenciennes lace at the sleeves and collar. and she had</p>
<p>always imagined herself wearing the traditional blue ribbons and garters, loosened ahead of time, of course, so the young men</p>
<p>could snatch them without difficulty. but there would be no new gown or blue ribbons or even the dreaded public</p>
<p>bedding, (she didn t think there would be) or even sadder still, there would be no ceremony in st mary</p>
<p>le bow, the local church, with all their family and friends in attendance and she unexpectedly felt such an overwhelming</p>
<p>pang of loss that she nearly burst into tears. their father should be here," they didn t remember their mother,</p>
<p>but their governess should be here too, their poor, loving governess who had acted as their mother for the past</p>
<p>fourteen years; and their neighbors, the davis from next door and the walmsleys from across the street. their friends, alice</p>
<p>and mary from their music lessons, should be here and sister maria and sister theresa from the church orphanage, to</p>
<p>name only a few. of course she knew they couldn t be here, but she had always thought that her</p>
<p>wedding day would be shared with her immediate family and friends, not with strangers that she had met only yesterday.</p>
<p>she felt so lonely for someone from her past that she couldn t stop the tears from rolling down her</p>
<p>cheeks and in an instant, maureen started fussing and making sympathetic noises. but elizabeth didn t even hear her; her</p>
<p>gaze was locked with evelyn s who understood her completely. evelyn reached for elizabeth s hand, gave it a squeeze</p>
<p>and said, "do not be sad, bess. maman and papa are watching us from heaven, and louise as well. they</p>
<p>would be happy for us. we should be happy too." elizabeth nodded, managing a wobbly smile. "i love you, bess."</p>
<p>evelyn whispered, embracing her sister. "remember, we ll always have each other." "i love you, too, evie." elizabeth whispered back.</p>
<p>she then took a shuddering breath, stepped back and accepted the handkerchief that maureen held out to her. she wiped</p>
<p>her eyes and cheeks dry, not wanting to meet her groom with swollen red eyes, a blotchy face and a</p>
<p>runny nose. "are you ready now?" maureen asked, kindness in her voice. evelyn exchanged a look with elizabeth, then nodded</p>
<p>and said, "we re ready." maureen kissed each girl on the cheek once before walking into the keeping room where</p>
<p>all the guests had been gathered for the ceremonies. the girls followed a few steps behind, holding hands and composed</p>
<p>once again. the first thing that elizabeth noticed was all the people standing along the back wall, facing the fireplace</p>
<p>where robert, iamie and the minister were waiting. the maiority of them looked weary and haggard, either from lack of</p>
<p>sleep or from too much drinking the night before. she understood their condition; one couldn t get too much rest</p>
<p>when one had to share a bed with four or more people or when one had to sleep in a</p>
<p>hayloft. but they had gladly stayed overnight and one more day to see the weddings of two of their most</p>
<p>favorite citizens because they didn t know when they could afford to take time away from their plantations again. she</p>
<p>also noticed the children, grouped together in the corner of the room. they were all seated on the floor, bribed</p>
<p>to keep quiet with saltets and marchpane. even robin was content to sit alongside his cousins, savoring the sweet treats.</p>
<p>surprisingly, the next thing elizabeth noticed was iamie, not robert, although she did glance at him, but iamie was</p>
