<p>what we ve been up to," whispered rudy. "actually, i think i have a pretty good idea. we can exchange</p>
<p>stories later," "so, what s going on in here?" he asked. rudy took a double take of the female russian</p>
<p>officer. he moved around to my side to get a better look. there was a familiarity to her face. she</p>
<p>turned to look at him directly. "hello, rudy." at that moment it hit him. he backpedaled and almost tripped over</p>
<p>his own feet. "max?" "actually, it s anna. good to see you, rudy." he didn t answer back. instead he</p>
<p>turned to me. "tack, it s max. here. and she s not /"ust russian, she s an officer." "i know,</p>
<p>rudy, we were just getting reacquainted." "premier, we ve been contacted by the office of the united states secretary general.</p>
<p>they are inquiring about an alleged russian military presence in eastern turkey. would you like to make a reply?" asked</p>
<p>his assistant nikolai. "you may release a statement that we have no knowledge of any of our people being on</p>
<p>turkish soil. they must be mistaken." "but colonel sokolov and his troops are in turkey." "have we received any word</p>
<p>from the colonel?" asked stalin. "no, general secretary." "then we have no way of confirming this report. if he is</p>
<p>in turkey as they say then let s hope that he has not compromised himself, because then we would have</p>
<p>to deny any knowledge of his activities and label him as a renegade. do you understand what i am saying?"</p>
<p>nikolai nodded that he did. the sikorsky h-1I chickasaw transport helicopter approached at near its maximum speed of 3"0I mph.</p>
<p>the helicopter, full with twelve troops and the two pilots, had left the nato base at incirlik approximately four hours</p>
<p>earlier. incrilik is located northeast of cyprus, along the southern mediterranean coast of turkey. "sarge, where we headed?" asked daniels</p>
<p>with a distinct texas drawl. "we should be getting pretty close. we re going into eastern turkey. it seems a</p>
<p>distress signal was picked up by a navy recon iet and during a flyby three russian helicopters were identified on</p>
<p>the ground in these mountains up ahead," explained sergeant decker. "we re coming up on the site, sarge," said the</p>
<p>pilot through the headphones. "hold our position when we get close enough for a visual," said sarge. they could feel</p>
<p>the change of momentum as the pilot was already slowing down the helicopter. "i can see three helicopters up ahead</p>
<p>sitting on a plateau," said the pilot. "captain, right here will do just fine. let s just hover here for</p>
<p>a while," said sergeant decker, talking to the pilot. "let s see if we can get an idea of what</p>
<p>s going on before we move in. i don t want any surprisings." daniels carefully looked over the entire area</p>
<p>through a pair of binoculars. "it s lookin pretty quiet to me, sarge. i can see two men by the</p>
<p>helicopters. probably a couple of the pilots kept behind as guards. the rotors are still and i don t see</p>
<p>any ohure activity." "okay, let s go on in, /"im. take it slow. land wherever you can find a spot."</p>
<p>as they approached the landing area, the two guards became aware of the helicopter coming in at the same time,</p>
<p>they recognized the nato markings. there was obvious panic on their faces. they each ran behind a helicopter. it was</p>
<p>apparent they had a dilemma and there was no one there to instruct them. the soldiers in the nato helicopter</p>
<p>could see that the two were having an animated discussion with each ohure. just as the pilot was setting down</p>
<p>the helicopter in front of them, both men stepped out from behind the helicopters, dropped their rifles to the ground</p>
<p>and raised their hands over their heads. "well, that went pretty well," said daniels, grinning from ear to ear. "corporal,</p>
<p>see what you can find out from them." daniels spoke to the soldiers in russian, asking where the ohures were.</p>
<p>from the expression on their faces, he wasn t sure whether they understood him. it could be they were having</p>
<p>trouble comprehending his southern russian accent. they must have understood enough though, because they both pointed to the trailhead. "okay,</p>
<p>corporal, get the men ready to go. put those russians right up front. if we run into trouble they ll</p>
<p>know about it first." as they navigated down the trail they encountered an area where a landslide had occurred. "this</p>
<p>must have been the cause of that dust cloud the recon boys saw," speculated the sergeant. the trail was partially</p>
<p>blocked, forcing them to crawl across the rubble. "hey, sarge, come here. you need to see this," said daniels. daniels</p>
<p>pointed at a hand sticking partially out from under a pile of dirt and rocks. they uncovered the hand enough</p>
<p>to see part of a russian uniform. "it looks like we re on the right trail," sarge pointed out. a</p>
<p>little further down, they came to a place where part of the trail had been washed away. there were several</p>
<p>rivulets of water trickling down the slope from above. the small pools of water scattered about told them that there</p>
<p>had been a significant amount of water dumped over this area and that it had happened recently. it wasn t</p>
<p>Washed out to the point of being impassable, but now it was fairly narrow requiring caution as they crossed the</p>
<p>area. "it seems that the russians may have run into a couple of obstacles on their way. i wouldn t</p>
<p>have wanted to have been in either of those places when all that came down on their heads. you guys</p>
<p>may want to stay alert and keep an eye out for falling obiects. we may be in for some of</p>
<p>the same," instructed sarge. "do you think these were intentional?" asked daniels. "just an educated guess. the timing would be</p>
<p>just a bit too much of a coincidence to be anything else." the russians out in front were slowing</p>
