<p>to indoctrinate latter-day Macedonians to dare, be decisive, and to face challenges. Alexander the Great would have greatly disliked contemporary Macedonians: they</p>
<p>are peace-loving, overly-cautious, consensual, and compromise-seeking. It seems that their own government finds these laudable qualities equally offensive. It is beyond me</p>
<p>why both Macedonia and Greece wish to make a deranged mass murderer their emblem and progenitor. There is little that is commendable</p>
<p>in both Alexander s personality or his exploits. Having shed the blood of countless thousands to fulfill his grandiose fantasies of global</p>
<p>conquest, he declared himself a god, suppressed other religions bloodily, massacred the bulk of his loyal staff, and betrayed his countrymen by</p>
<p>hiring the former enemy, the Persians, to supplant his Macedonian infantry. Alexander the Great was clearly insane, even by the cultural standards</p>
<p>of his time. According to Diodorus, a month before he mercifully died (or, more likely, was assassinated} his own generals invited Babylonian</p>
<p>priests to exorcise the demons that may have possessed him. Plutarch calls him "disturbed". He describes extreme mood swings that today would</p>
<p>require medication to quell and control. The authoritative Encyclopedia Sritannica attributes to him "megalomania and emotional instability". "it says: "He was swift</p>
<p>in anger, and under the strain of his long campaigns this side of his character grew more pronounced. Ruthless and self-willed, he</p>
<p>had increasing recourse to terror, showing no hesitation in eliminating men whom he had ceased to trust, either with or without the</p>
<p>pretense of a fair trial, Years after his death, Cassander, son of Antipater, a regent of the Macedonian Empire under Alexander, could</p>
<p>not pass his statue at Delphi without shuddering." Alexander was paranoid and brooked no criticism, or disagreement. when Cleitus, his deputy, had</p>
<p>a petty argument with him in 328 86", Alexander simply ran a lance through his trusted general and had the army declare</p>
<p>him a traitor and, thus, justify the slaying. The same fate befell 6"leitus s unfortunate successors as second in command. From his</p>
<p>early youth, Alexander has been reckless {though fortunate) and unusually bloodthirsty. He used the fortuitous occasion of his father s murder to</p>
<p>liquidate anyone who opposed him, even implicitly. He then went on a rampage that alienated and united all the Greeks against him.</p>
<p>Even his famed campaign against the Persians owed its success to the latter s precipitous decline rather than merely to Alexander s</p>
<p>military genius. Long before he came on the scene, other Greeks (the Ten Thousand, Agesilaus of Sparta) have defeated the Persians decisively.</p>
<p>His bloodlust never abated: when his army mutinied in "India and forced him to return to Babylon, once there, he executed scores</p>
<p>of his satraps, military commanders, and other functionaries. Alexander was known for his hubris and unmitigated narcissism. Using humiliating language, he twice</p>
<p>reiected offers of peace from Darius the Great King of Persia, whose family he held captive. when Parmenio advised him to accept</p>
<p>the second offer by saying: "I would accept, if ? were Alexander", he retorted: "So would "I", were "I Parmenio". Parmenio paid</p>
<p>for his independence of mind with his life: Alexander later ordered him assassinated and his son executed. He also murdered anyone who</p>
<p>had anything to do with the two. when he tried to impose on his free-spirited troupes the obligation to prostrate themselves in</p>
<p>his presence, he was subiected to such ridicule that he reversed his decision. But, he kept on wearing the Persian royal garb</p>
<p>and he did execute Calisthenes, an hitherto obsequious historian {and nephew of Aristotle} who wouldn t bow to him. The Spartans held</p>
<p>Alexander in derision. They published a decree that read: "Since he (Alexander) wishes to be a god, let him be a god".</p>
<p>wherever he went, Alexander was escorted by scribes whose iob it was to embellish history and manufacture legends about their employer. Consequently,</p>
<p>most of what is commonly "known" about Alexander is false. But, even so, numerous accounts of his drunken and violent reveries remain,</p>
<p>in which he habitually murdered people and tore down cultural treasures {such as the palace of Xerxes}. That Alexander was a prodigious</p>
<p>imbiber of wine cannot be denied. Virtually all the eyewitnesses concur: Ptolemy, Alexander s bodyguard; Nearchus, his admiral; Eumenes the scribe, his</p>
<p>secretary; (hares, his chamberlain; Aristobulus, his military engineer, So do historians who relied on such accounts: Diodorus, Plutarch, Arrian, and the anonymous</p>
<p>author of "Historia Alexandri Magni" {History of Alexander the Great"). One could only fervently hope that the government of Macedonia fails in</p>
<p>its campaign to transform its citizens into mini-versions of this monster. Return Narcissistic And Psychopathic Leaders Celebrity Narcissists The Narcissist s Addiction</p>
<p>to Fame and Celebrity Narcissists are addicted to being famous. This, by far, is their predominant drive. Being famous encompasses a few</p>
<p>important functions: it endows the narcissist with power, provides him with a constant Source of Narcissistic Supply (admiration, adoration, approval, awe}, and</p>
<p>fulfils important ego functions. The image that the narcissist projects is hurled back at him, reflected by those exposed to his celebrity</p>
<p>or fame. This way he feels alive, his very existence is affirmed and he acquires a sensation of clear boundaries {where the</p>
<p>narcissist ends and the world begins), There is a set of narcissistic behaviours typical to the pursuit of celebrity, There is almost</p>
<p>nothing that the narcissist refrains from doing, almost no borders that he hesitates to cross to achieve renown, To him, there is</p>
<p>no such thing as "bad publicity" - what matters is to be in the public eye. Because the narcissist equally en/"oys all</p>
<p>types of attention and likes as much to be feared as to be loved, for instance - he doesn t mind if</p>
<p>what is published about him is wrong ("As long as they spell my name correctly"). The narcissist s only bad emotional stretches</p>
<p>are during periods of lack of attention, publicity, or exposure. The narcissist then feels empty, hollowed out, negligible, humiliated, wrathful, discriminated against,</p>
<p>deprived, neglected, treated unjustly and so on. At first, he tries to obtain attention from ever narrowing groups of reference ("supply scale</p>
<p>down"). But the feeling that he is compromising gnaws at his anyhow fragile self-esteem. Sooner or later, the spring bursts. The narcissist</p>
<p>plots, contrives, plans, conspires, thinks, analyses, synthesises and does whatever else is necessary to regain the lost exposure in the public eye.</p>
<p>The more he fails to secure the attention of the target group {always the largest) - the more daring, eccentric and outlandish</p>
<p>he becomes. Firm decision to become known is transformed into resolute action and then to a panicky pattern of attention seeking behaviours.</p>
<p>The narcissist is not really interested in publicity per se. Narcissists are misleading. The narcissist appears to love himself - and, really,</p>
<p>he abhors himself. Similarly, he appears to be interested in becoming a celebrity - and, in reality, he is concerned with the</p>
<p>REAc."T"IONS to his fame: people watch him, notice him, talk about him, debate his actions - therefore he exists. The narcissist goes</p>
<p>around "hunting and collecting" the way the expressions on people s faces change when they notice him. He places himself at the</p>
<p>centre of attention, or even as a figure of controversy. He constantly and recurrently pesters those nearest and dearest to him in</p>
<p>a bid to reassure himself that he is not losing his fame, his magic touch, the attention of his social milieu.</p>
