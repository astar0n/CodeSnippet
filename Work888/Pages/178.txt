<p>iamie at the end of this day. and she also remembered how she had felt on those occasions; how she</p>
<p>would come home feeling weary and saddened and her governess would hold her while she cried copious tears into her</p>
<p>apron. evelyn would always ask her why so many little children had to die and she would answer that only</p>
<p>god knew how to answer that. and then evelyn would ask her why didn t she, herself, and elizabeth become</p>
<p>sick, and louise would always answer that they came from good, strong stock. but evelyn wondered about this because if</p>
<p>that were true then why had their mother died at such a young age? but louise had an answer for</p>
<p>that question too; she would always look into evelyn s eyes and say, your mother loved your father so much</p>
<p>that she didn t heed the dreams. as evelyn continued to worry over iamie, she also worried over the fact</p>
<p>that she hadn t had any dreams concerning her future with him. did that mean that there wouldn t be</p>
<p>any future? did that mean that he was going to die this day? dear god, she hoped not! iamie s</p>
<p>breathing changed slightly," she noticed that it seemed to be coming quicker, evelyn could even see the pulse in his</p>
<p>neck, throbbing faster than her own heartbeat. he was becoming restless, moving his head back and forth on the pillow</p>
<p>and squirming under the quilts. she wished she knew what she could do for him to ease his discomfort; she</p>
<p>wished she was more knowledgeable of medicines and simples. but she and elizabeth had been blessed with excellent health and</p>
<p>other than the occasional cold or stomachache, neither one of them had ever needed any medical attention. suddenly iamie threw</p>
<p>all the covers off of him, startling her, and shocking her! he was naked, naked as a dickey bird! no</p>
<p>nightshirt, no smallclothes, no nothing! she felt her own face flush with heat as she stared quite overtly. she knew</p>
<p>she shouldn t; she knew it was quite inappropriate for her to be eyeing his privy parts. she was an</p>
<p>innocent maiden, for heaven s sake; and he was extremely ill and vulnerable, but oh, il est magnifique! she thought</p>
<p>shamelessly, but then sense and detachment returned, she was here to care for him, not to ogle him! with gentle</p>
<p>hands she drew the quilt back over iamie s lower body, settling the top edge neatly at his chest. he</p>
<p>must have felt the weight because he opened his heavy-lidded eyes and looked at her. she smiled and said, "you</p>
<p>threw the covers off." "so hot in here." he whispered. apparently he had been too groggy to notice that he</p>
<p>had just exposed his naked body to her or he just didn t care. "i ll open the window." she</p>
<p>said, believing fresh air would do him good. she stood up, but then had second thoughts and she turned back</p>
<p>to him. "or would you rather i not open it?" she knew how some people believed that windows should be</p>
<p>kept firmly shut against deadly miasmas and while she had been living in london she had understood this. but even</p>
<p>in london when the breeze was blowing enough to clear the air, evelyn s governess would open all the windows</p>
<p>in hers and Ô¨Ålizabeth s bedchambers and louise would tell them stories of the beautiful diane de poitiers, king henri</p>
<p>ii s mistress who believed in daily bathing and riding out in the fresh air even morning, evelyn imagined that</p>
<p>the air here in virginia was as fresh and clean as the air had been in the royal forests of</p>
<p>france and didn t believe it carried any disease. iamie nodded imperceptibly. "open it," he whispered, closing his eyes, he</p>
<p>sighed and seemed to sink deeper into the mattress and for a short, frightening moment she thought he had died.</p>
<p>but in the next moment his chest rose with his next breath and she almost swooned in relief. quickly, she</p>
<p>turned and scurried across the room to open the window. robert returned at that moment and evelyn breathed a sigh</p>
<p>of relief. he would know what to do and in fact he was carrying a tray with two tankards, one</p>
<p>small pitcher and a bowl with a hunk of brown bread in it. "how is he?" he asked, his attention</p>
<p>focused on his brother. "worse, i think." evelyn answered, returning to iamie s side and close to robert, but not</p>
<p>that close that she was in his way. she Wanted to see what he had brought for iamie to drink</p>
<p>and how he cared for him, as iamie s wife she knew she would be the one to take care</p>
<p>of iamie during any future bouts of the intermittent fever. iamie appeared to be sleeping but opened his eyes as</p>
<p>robert moved closer. "you could ask me." he said, sounding annoyed. he hated it when people talked about him as</p>
<p>if he weren t right there in front of them. and that had happened a lot in the past whenever</p>
<p>he had lain ill. he pushed the covers down again, baring his upper body, but stopped at his waist. "all</p>
<p>right." robert said good-naturedly, ignoring iamie s tone. he placed the tray down on the floor next to the trundle</p>
<p>bed, then sat back on his heels. he flashed iamie a cheeky grin as he inquired, "so, how are you,</p>
<p>brother mine?" "i feel like shit." iamie grumbled. robert burst out laughing. his bark of laughter was rather loud in</p>
<p>the quiet room. and despite her worry for iamie, evelyn nearly burst out laughing too: she had to clap her</p>
<p>hands over her mouth to stop herself. poor iamie, he sounded so miserable and she felt terribly sorry for him,</p>
<p>but continued to hide a smile behind her hand. "you look worse." robert chuckled, but then he felt iamie s</p>
<p>neck with the back of his hand and quickly sobered. "my god, you re burning up! i ve brought</p>
