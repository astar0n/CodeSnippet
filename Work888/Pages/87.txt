<p>one, the historical-cultural one, and the psychological-emotional one. Vn evolutionary terms, good iudgment and intelligence equal survival and the transmission of one</p>
<p>s genes across the generations, Faithfulness and a sense of responsibility (financial and otherwise) guarantee that the woman s partner will persevere</p>
<p>in the all-important tasks of homebuilding and childfcaring. Finally, being affectionate cements the emotional bond between male and female and militates against</p>
<p>potentially life-threatening maltreatment and abuse of the latter by the former. From the historical-cultural point of view, most societies and cultures, well</p>
<p>into the previous century, have been male-dominated and patriarchal. The male s iudgment prevailed and his decisions dictated the course of the</p>
<p>couple s life. An intelligent and financially responsible male provided a secure environment in which to raise children. The woman lived through</p>
<p>her man, vicariously: his successes and failures reflected on her and determined her standing in society and her ability to develop and</p>
<p>thrive on the personal level. His faithfulness and affections served to prevent competitors from usurping the female s place and thus threatening</p>
<p>her male-dependent cosmos. Granted, evolutionary constraints are anachronistic and social-cultural mores have changed: women, at least in western societies, are now independent,</p>
<p>both emotionally and economically. Yet, millennia of conditioned behavior cannot be eradicated in a few decades. women continue to look in men</p>
<p>for the qualities that used to matter in entirely different circumstances. Finally, women are more level-headed when it comes to bonding. They</p>
<p>tend to emphasize long-term relationships, based on reciprocity and the adhesive qualities of strong emotions. Good iudgment, intelligence, and a developed sense</p>
<p>of responsibility are crucial to the maintenance and preservation of functional, lasting, and durable couples - and so are faithfulness and being</p>
<p>affectionate. Soaring divorce rates and the rise of single parenthood prove that women are not good at recognizing the qualities they seek</p>
<p>in men. It is not easy to tell apart the genuine article from the unctuous pretender. while intelligence {or lack thereof) can</p>
<p>be discerned on a first date, it is difficult to predict traits such as faithfulness, good iudgment, and reliability. Affections can really</p>
<p>be mere affectations and women are sometimes so desperate for a mate that they delude themselves and treat their date as a</p>
<p>blank screen onto which they pro/"ect their wishes and needs. Q. what are the top 5 Things Men Look for in a</p>
<p>woman, the top five qualities? why is this something men look for in women - why is it important? How does this</p>
<p>quality positively affect a relationship or marriage? How do men recognize it? A. From my experience and correspondence with thousands of couples,</p>
<p>men seem to place a premium on these qualities in a woman: 1. Physical Attraction and Sexual Availability 2. Good-naturedness 3. Faithfulness</p>
<p>4, Protective Affectionateness 5. Dependability There are three possible explanations as to why men look for these qualities in women: the evolutionary-biological</p>
<p>one, the historical-cultural one, and the psychological-emotional one. "in evolutionary terms, physical attractiveness denotes good underlying health and genetic-immunological compatibility. These guarantee</p>
<p>the efficacious transmission of one s genes to future generations. Of course, having sex is a precondition for bearing children and, so,</p>
<p>sexual availability is important, but only when it is coupled with faithfulness: men are loth to raise and invest scarce resource in</p>
<p>someone else s progeny. Dependable women are more likely to propagate the species, so they are desirable. Finally, men and women are</p>
<p>likely to do a better iob of raising a family if the woman is good-natured, easy-going, adaptable, affectionate, and mothering. These qualities</p>
<p>cement the emotional bond between male and female and prevent potentially life-threatening maltreatment and abuse of the latter by the former. From</p>
<p>the historical-cultural point of view, most societies and cultures, well into the previous century, have been male-dominated and patriarchal, women were treated</p>
<p>as chattels or possessions, an extension of the male. The "ownership" of an attractive female advertised to the world the male s</p>
<p>prowess and desirability. Her good nature, affectionateness, and protectiveness proved that her man was a worthwhile "CatCh" and elevated his social status.</p>
<p>Her dependability and faithfulness allowed him to embark on long trips or complex, long-term undertakings without the distractions of emotional uncertainty and</p>
<p>the anxieties of letdown and betrayal. Finally, men are more cavalier when it comes to bonding. They tend to maintain both long-term</p>
<p>and short-term relationships and are, therefore, far less exclusive and monogamous than women. They are more concerned with what they are getting</p>
<p>out of a relationship than with reciprocity and, though they often feel as strongly as women and can be equally romantic, their</p>
<p>emotional landscape and expression are more constrained and they sometimes confuse love with possessiveness or even codependence. Thus, men tend to emphasize</p>
<p>the external (physical attraction) and the functional (good-naturedness, faithfulness, reliability) over the internal and the purely emotional. Soaring divorce rates and the</p>
<p>rise of single parenthood prove that men are not good at recognizing the qualities they seek in women. "it is not easy</p>
<p>to tell apart the genuine article from the unctuous pretender. while physical attractiveness (or lack thereof} can be discerned on a first</p>
<p>date, it is difficult to predict traits such as faithfulness, good-naturedness, and reliability. Affections can really be mere affectations and men are</p>
<p>sometimes such narcissistic navel-gazers that they delude themselves and treat their date as a blank screen onto which they project their wishes</p>
<p>and needs. M Marriage Despite all the fashionable theories of marriage, the narratives and the feminists, the reasons to get married largely</p>
<p>remain the same. True, there have been role reversals and new stereotypes have cropped up. 8ut biological, physiological and biochemical facts are</p>
<p>less amenable to modern criticisms of culture, Men are still men and women are still women, Men and women marry to form:</p>
<p>The Sexual Dyad - "Intended to gratify the partners sexual attraction and secures a stable, consistent and available source of sexual gratification.</p>
<p>The Economic Dyad - The couple is a functioning economic unit within which the economic activities of the members of the dyad</p>
<p>and of additional entrants are carried out. The economic unit generates more wealth than it consumes and the synergy between its members</p>
<p>is likely to lead to gains in production and in productivity relative to individual efforts and investments. The Social Dyad - The</p>
<p>members of the couple bond as a result of implicit or explicit, direct, or indirect social pressures. Such pressure can manifest itself</p>
<p>in numerous forms. "In ï¬‚udaism, a person cannot hold some religious posts unless he is married. This is a form of economic</p>
<p>pressure. "In most human societies, avowed bachelors are considered to be socially deviant and abnormal. They are condemned by society, ridiculed, shunned</p>
<p>and isolated, effectively ex-communicated. Partly to avoid these sanctions and partly to enioy the emotional glow that comes with conformity and acceptance,</p>
<p>couples get married. Today, a myriad lifestyles are on offer. The old fashioned, nuclear family is one of many variants. Children are</p>
<p>reared by single parents. Homosexual couples bind and abound. 8ut a pattern is discernible all the same: almost I5% of the adult</p>
<p>population get married ultimately. They settle into a two-member arrangement, whether formalized and sanctioned religiously or legally - or not. The Companionship</p>
