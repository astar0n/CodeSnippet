<p>they all had acquired a portuguese license and paid duty on their cargo at some portuguese-controlled tax point. after evaluating</p>
<p>the risk of exposing his english frigates at the bar-where maneuverability was limited and the possibility of portuguese surprise great-brian</p>
<p>hawksworth had elected to unlade directly onshore from their protected anchorage north of the river mouth, the cove called swalley,</p>
<p>then haul the goods overland to the banks of the tapti opposite surat. there would be no risk of portuguese</p>
<p>interference inland and, once across from the port, the goods could be easily barged to the maidan. he turned again</p>
<p>toward the river and examined the town of surat from his new vantage. it was easy to see now why</p>
<p>this location had been chosen for the port, for here the river curved and widened, creating a natural, protected harbor,</p>
<p>the most conspicuous landmarks visible from across the harbor were three stone villas along the riverfront, all owned by the</p>
<p>shahbandar", and the square stone fort that stood on the downriver side of the harbor, its heavy ordnance trained perpetually</p>
<p>on the water. the fort was surrounded by a moat on three sides and on the fourth by the river,</p>
<p>entry could only be gained through a gate on the riverside, or a drawbridge that connected its entrance to the</p>
<p>open maidan, the square where traders congregated. the square had swarmed with merchants and brokers as they passed through, and</p>
<p>he had watched as two brokers stood together near its center-one from ahmedabad, up-country, and the other from surat-arguing loudly</p>
<p>over the price and quality of a pile of indigo. the porters explained that the surat broker was accusing the</p>
<p>other of mixing sand with the indigo to increase its weight, then disguising his deception by also adding enough oil</p>
<p>that the indigo would still float on water, the test used to establish purity of the dried extract of the</p>
<p>indigo leaf. as the argument grew more vigorous, hawksworth noticed the men join hands beneath a piece of cloth, where</p>
<p>they began negotiating the actual price by means of their fingers, a figure undoubtedly little related to the movement of</p>
<p>their tongues. now that the high trading season of september-ianuary had begun, surat s narrow streets were one loud bazaar,</p>
<p>swollen to" almost two hundred thousand grasping traders, bargaining seamen, hawking merchants. a dozen languages stirred the air as a</p>
<p>motley melange of up-country indian traders, arabs, iains, parsis, persians, iews, egyptians, portuguese, and returning muslim pilgrims-every nationality known to</p>
<p>the indian ocean-swaggered through the garbage-sodden mud paths called streets. hawksworth gazed back at the city and reflected over the</p>
<p>curious events of the past three weeks. the english had, inexplicably, been received first with open hostility, and then with</p>
<p>suspiciously cordial deference-first by the governor, and afterward by the shahbandar. something is very wrong, he told himself. a contest</p>
<p>of wills is underway between the shahbandar, mirza nuruddin, and the governor, mukarrab khan. and so far, mukarrab khan seems</p>
<p>to be winning. or is he? six days before, the governor had suddenly reversed his policy of noninterference in port</p>
<p>affairs and authorized a license for the english to sell their cargo in surat and buy indian goods, something the</p>
<p>shahbandar" had found one excuse after another to delay. however, mukarrab khan had delivered this license directly to the english,</p>
<p>rather than forwarding it to the shahbandar through normal channels, leaving brian hawksworth the unpleasant responsibility of presenting this document</p>
<p>to the shahbandar in person. but the meeting turned out to be nothing like hawksworth had expected. "once more you</p>
<p>astound me, captain." the close, torch-lit chamber of the customs house office had fallen expectantly silent as the shahbandar drew</p>
<p>slowly on his hookah and squinted with his opaque, glassy eyes at the black seal of mukarrab khan affixed to</p>
<p>the top of the page. hawksworth had waited for a glimmer of anger at this insulting breach of port protocol-which</p>
<p>surely was mukarrab khan s reason for insisting the license be delivered by the english captain-general. but the shahbandar s</p>
<p>eyes never lost their noncommittal squint. instead he had turned to hawksworth with a cordial smile. "your refusal to negotiate</p>
<p>seems to have worked remarkable dispatch with his excellency s officials. i can t recall ever seeing them act this</p>
<p>quickly." hawksworth had been amazed. how could mirza nuruddin possibly know the terms he had demanded of the governor: produce</p>
<p>a license for trade within ten days or the two english frigates would weigh anchor and sail; and accept english</p>
<p>sovereigns at bullion value rather than the prevailing discount rate of 4 1/2 percent required to circumvent "minting time," the</p>
<p>weeks "required" by the shahbandar s minters to melt down foreign coin and re-mint it as indian rupees. no one</p>
<p>could have been more surprised than brian hawksworth when mukarrab khan had immediately conceded the english terms and approved the</p>
<p>license-valid for sixty days-to land goods, and to buy and sell. why had the governor agreed so readily, overriding the</p>
<p>shahbandar s dawdling clerks? "naturally you ll need an officer here to schedule the river barks." the shahbandar s voice</p>
<p>was even, but hawksworth thought he sensed an air of tension suddenly grip the room. "normally barks are reserved weeks</p>
<p>in advance now during the high season, but we can always accommodate friends of mukarrab khan." it was then that</p>
<p>hawksworth had told the shahbandar he would not be bringing cargo up the river, that instead it would be transported</p>
<p>overland from their protected anchorage using bullock carts arranged for by mukarrab khan, "the cove you call swalley is several</p>
<p>leagues up the coast, captain. foreign cargo has never before been unladed there, nor has it ever been brought overland</p>
<p>as you propose." he had seemed genuinely disturbed. "i suggest it s both irregular and unworkable." "i think you understand</p>
<p>why we have to unlade from the cove. the decision is made." hawksworth tried to keep his voice as firm</p>
<p>as that of mirza nuruddin. "we ll unload the bullock carts /"ust across the river from the port here,</p>
