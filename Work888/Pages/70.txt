in the answer No. I01 of 865 Great Expectations Do you know what
I touch here? she said, laying her hands, one upon the other, on
her left side. Yes, ma am. (It made me think of the young
man.) what do I touch? Your heart. Broken! She uttered the word with
an eager look, and with strong emphasis, and with a weird smile that
had a kind of boast in it. Afterwards, she kept her hands there
for a little while, and slowly took them away as if they were
heavy. I am tired, said Miss Havisham. I want diversion, and I have
done with men and women. Play. I think it will be conceded by
my most disputatious reader, that she could hardly have directed an unfortunate boy
to do anything in the wide world more difficult to be done under
the circumstances, I sometimes have sick fancies, she went on, and I have
a sick fancy that I want to see some play. There there! with
an impatient movement of the fingers of her right hand; play, play, play!
For a moment, with the fear of my sister s working me before
my eyes, I had a desperate idea of Starting round the room in
the assumed character of Mr. Pumblechook s chaise-cart. But, I felt myself so
unequal to the I02 of 865 Great Expectations performance that I gave it
up, and stood looking at Miss Havisham in what I suppose she took
for a dogged manner, inasmuch as she said, when we had taken a
good look at each other: Are you sullen and obstinate? No, ma am,
I am very sorry for you, and very sorry I can t play
just now. I:" you complain of me I shall get into trouble with
my sister, so I would do it if I could; but it s
so new here, and so strange, and so fine - and melancholy-. I
stopped, fearing I might say too much, or had already said it, and
we took another look at each other. Before she spoke again, she turned
her eyes from me, and looked at the dress she wore, and at
the dressing-table, and finally at herself in the looking-glass. So new to him,
she muttered, so old to me; so strange to him, so familiar to
me; so melancholy to both of us! (all Estella. As she was still
looking at the reflection of herself, I thought she was still talking to
herself, and kept quiet. Call Estella, she repeated, flashing a look at me.

dark in a mysterious passage of an unknown house, bawling Estella to a
scornful young lady 103 of 865 Great Expectations neither visible nor responsive, and
feeling it a dreadful liberty so to roar out her name, was almost
as bad as playing to order. But, she answered at last, and her
light came along the dark passage like a star. Miss Havisham beckoned her
to come close, and took up a iewel from the table, and tried
its effect upon her fair young bosom and against her pretty brown hair.
Your own, one day, my dear, and you will use it well. Let
me see you play cards with this boy. with this boy? why, he
is a common labouring-boy! I thought I overheard Miss Havisham answer - only
it seemed so unlikely - well? You can break his heart. what do
