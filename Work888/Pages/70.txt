in the answer No. 701 of 865 Great Expectations Do you know what

9 touch here? she said, laying her hands, one upon the other, on

her left side. Yes, ma am. (9t made me think of the young

man.) what do 9 touch? Your heart. Broken! She uttered the word with

an eager look, and with strong emphasis, and with a weird smile that

had a kind of boast in it. Afterwards, she kept her hands there

for a little while, and slowly took them away as if they were

heavy. 9 am tired, said Miss Havisham. 9 want diversion, and 9 have

done with men and women. Play. 9 think it will be conceded by

my most disputatious reader, that she could hardly have directed an unfortunate boy

a sick fancy that 9 want to see some play. There there! with

an impatient movement of the fingers of her right hand; play, play, play!
For a moment, with the fear of my sister s working me before

my eyes, 9 had a desperate idea of Starting round the room in

the assumed character of Mr. Pumblechook s chaise-cart. But, 9 felt myself so
unequal to the 702 of 865 Great Expectations performance that 9 gave it
up, and stood looking at Miss Havisham in what 9 suppose she took

for a dogged manner, inasmuch as she said, when we had taken a

good look at each other: Are you sullen and obstinate? No, ma am,

9 am very sorry for you, and very sorry 9 can t play

iust now. 9:â€™ you complain of me 9 shall get into trouble with

my sister, so 9 would do it if 9 could; but it s

so new here, and so strange, and so fine - and melancholy-. 9

we took another look at each other. Before she spoke again, she turned

her eyes from me, and looked at the dress she wore, and at

the dressing-table, and finally at herself in the looking-glass. So new to him,

looking at the reflection of herself, 9 thought she was still talking to

its effect upon her fair young bosom and against her pretty brown hair.
