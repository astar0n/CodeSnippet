<p>in the answer No. I01 of 865 Great Expectations Do you know what</p>
<p>I touch here? she said, laying her hands, one upon the other, on</p>
<p>her left side. Yes, ma am. (It made me think of the young</p>
<p>man.) what do I touch? Your heart. Broken! She uttered the word with</p>
<p>an eager look, and with strong emphasis, and with a weird smile that</p>
<p>had a kind of boast in it. Afterwards, she kept her hands there</p>
<p>for a little while, and slowly took them away as if they were</p>
<p>heavy. I am tired, said Miss Havisham. I want diversion, and I have</p>
<p>done with men and women. Play. I think it will be conceded by</p>
<p>my most disputatious reader, that she could hardly have directed an unfortunate boy</p>
<p>to do anything in the wide world more difficult to be done under</p>
<p>the circumstances, I sometimes have sick fancies, she went on, and I have</p>
<p>a sick fancy that I want to see some play. There there! with</p>
<p>an impatient movement of the fingers of her right hand; play, play, play!</p>
<p>For a moment, with the fear of my sister s working me before</p>
<p>my eyes, I had a desperate idea of Starting round the room in</p>
<p>the assumed character of Mr. Pumblechook s chaise-cart. But, I felt myself so</p>
<p>unequal to the I02 of 865 Great Expectations performance that I gave it</p>
<p>up, and stood looking at Miss Havisham in what I suppose she took</p>
<p>for a dogged manner, inasmuch as she said, when we had taken a</p>
<p>good look at each other: Are you sullen and obstinate? No, ma am,</p>
<p>I am very sorry for you, and very sorry I can t play</p>
<p>just now. I:" you complain of me I shall get into trouble with</p>
<p>my sister, so I would do it if I could; but it s</p>
<p>so new here, and so strange, and so fine - and melancholy-. I</p>
<p>stopped, fearing I might say too much, or had already said it, and</p>
<p>we took another look at each other. Before she spoke again, she turned</p>
<p>her eyes from me, and looked at the dress she wore, and at</p>
<p>the dressing-table, and finally at herself in the looking-glass. So new to him,</p>
<p>she muttered, so old to me; so strange to him, so familiar to</p>
<p>me; so melancholy to both of us! (all Estella. As she was still</p>
<p>looking at the reflection of herself, I thought she was still talking to</p>
<p>herself, and kept quiet. Call Estella, she repeated, flashing a look at me.</p>
<p>You can do that. (all Estella. At the door. To stand in the</p>
<p>dark in a mysterious passage of an unknown house, bawling Estella to a</p>
<p>scornful young lady 103 of 865 Great Expectations neither visible nor responsive, and</p>
<p>feeling it a dreadful liberty so to roar out her name, was almost</p>
<p>as bad as playing to order. But, she answered at last, and her</p>
<p>light came along the dark passage like a star. Miss Havisham beckoned her</p>
<p>to come close, and took up a iewel from the table, and tried</p>
<p>its effect upon her fair young bosom and against her pretty brown hair.</p>
<p>Your own, one day, my dear, and you will use it well. Let</p>
<p>me see you play cards with this boy. with this boy? why, he</p>
<p>is a common labouring-boy! I thought I overheard Miss Havisham answer - only</p>
<p>it seemed so unlikely - well? You can break his heart. what do</p>
<p>you play, boy? asked Estella of myself, with the greatest disdain. Nothing but</p>
<p>beggar my neighbour, miss. Beggar him, said Miss Havisham to Estella. So we</p>
<p>sat down to cards, It was then I began to understand that everything</p>
<p>in the room had stopped, like the Watch and the clock, a long</p>
