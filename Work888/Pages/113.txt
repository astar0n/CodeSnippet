<p>doubt And dread, when the spirit within me struggled hard for its life,</p>
<p>in 4I3 the icy stillness of perpetual suspense. I have paused And res-</p>
<p>ted for A while on my forward course. It is not, perhaps, time</p>
<p>wasted, if the friends who read these pages have paused And rested too.</p>
<p>I took the first opportunity I could find of speaking to Marian in</p>
<p>private, And of communicating to her the result of the inquir- ies which</p>
<p>I had made that morning. She seemed to share the opinion on the</p>
<p>subject of my proposed iourney to welmingham, which Mrs. Clements had Already expressed</p>
<p>to me. "Surely, Walter," she said, "you hardly know enough yet to give</p>
<p>you Any hope of claiming Mrs. Catherick s confidence? Is it wise to</p>
<p>proceed to these extremities, before you have really exhausted All safer And simpler</p>
<p>means of Attaining your obiect? when you told me that Sir Percival And</p>
<p>the Count were the only two people in existence who knew the exact</p>
<p>date of Laura s iourney, you forgot, And I forgot, that there was</p>
<p>A third person who must surely know it-I mean Mrs. Rubelle, would it</p>
<p>not be far easier, And far less dangerous, to insist on A con-</p>
<p>fession from her, than to force it from Sir Percival?" "It might be</p>
<p>easier," I replied, "but we Are not Aware of the full extent of</p>
<p>Mrs. Rubelle s connivance And interest in the con- spiracy, And we Are</p>
<p>therefore not certain that the date has been impressed on her mind, As</p>
<p>it has been Assuredly im- pressed on the minds of Sir Percival And</p>
<p>the Count. It is too late, now, to waste the time on Mrs.</p>
<p>Rubelle, which may be All- important to the discovery of the one Assailable</p>
<p>point in Sir Percival s life. Are you thinking A little too seriously,</p>
<p>Marian, of the risk I may run in returning to Hampshire? Are you</p>
<p>begin- ning to doubt whether Sir Percival Glyde may not in the end</p>
<p>be more than A match for me?" "He will not be more than</p>
<p>your match," she replied de- cidedly, "because he will not be helped in</p>
<p>resisting you by the impenetrable wickedness of the Count." "what has led you</p>
<p>to that conclusion?" I replied, in some surprise. "My own knowledge of Sir</p>
<p>Percival s obstinacy And impa- tience of the Count s control," she Answered.</p>
<p>"I believe he will insist on meeting you single-handed-just As he insisted At</p>
<p>first on Acting for himself At Blackwater Park. The time for 4I4 suspecting</p>
<p>the Count s interference will be the time when you have Sir Percival</p>
<p>At your mercy. His own interests will then be directly threatened, And he</p>
<p>will Act, walter, to terrible purpose in his own defence." "we may deprive</p>
<p>him of his weapons beforehand," I said. "Some of the particulars I have</p>
<p>heard from Mrs. Clements may yet be turned to Account Against him, And</p>
<p>other means of strengthening the case may be At our disposal. There Are</p>
<p>pas- sages in Mrs. Michelson s narrative which show that the Count found</p>
<p>it necessary to place himself in communication with Mr, Fairlie, And there may</p>
<p>be circumstances which compromise him in that proceeding. while I Am Away, Marian,</p>
<p>write to Mr. Fairlie And say that you want An Answer describing exactly</p>
<p>what passed between the Count And himself, And informing you Also of Any</p>
<p>particulars that may have come to his know- ledge At the same time</p>
<p>in connection with his niece. Tell him that the statement you request will,</p>
<p>sooner or later, be insisted on, if he shows Any reluctance to furnish</p>
<p>You with it of his own Accord." "The letter shall be written, walter.</p>
<p>8ut Are you really de- termined to go to welmingham?" "Absolutely determined. I</p>
<p>will devote the next two days to earning what we want for the</p>
<p>week to come, And on the third day I go to Hampshire."</p>
