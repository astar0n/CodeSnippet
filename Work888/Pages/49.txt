<p>myself. we are shipwrecked travelers, but it may be important to state that we have taken no part in the</p>
<p>war," "that matters little!" was the brutal answer of kara-tete. "even englishman is an enemy. your people invaded our island!</p>
<p>they robbed our fields.-" they burned our villages!" "they Were wrong!" said glenarvan, quietly. "i say so, because i think</p>
<p>it, not because i am in your power." "listen," said kai-koumou, "the tohonga, the chief priest of noui-atoua has fallen</p>
<p>into the hands of your brethren; he is a prisoner among the pakekas. our deity has commanded us to ransom</p>
<p>him. for my own part, i would rather have torn out your heart, i would have stuck your head, and</p>
<p>those of your companions, on the posts of that palisade. but noui-atoua has spoken." as he uttered these words, kai-koumou,</p>
<p>who till now had been quite unmoved, trembled with rage, and his features expressed intense ferocity. then after a few</p>
<p>minutes interval he proceeded more calmly, "do you think the english will exchange you for our tohonga?" glenarvan hesitated, all</p>
<p>the while watching the maori chief. "i do not know," said he, after a moment of silence. "speak," returned kai-koumou,</p>
<p>"is your life worth that of our tohonga?" "no," replied glenarvan. "i am neither a chief nor a priest among</p>
<p>my own people." paganel, petrified at this reply, looked at glenarvan in amazement. kai-koumou appeared equally astonished. "you doubt it</p>
<p>then?" said he. "i do not know," replied glenarvan. "your people will not accept you as an exchange for tohonga?"</p>
<p>"me alone? no," repeated glenarvan. "all of us perhaps they might." "our maori custom," replied kai-koumou, "is head for head."</p>
<p>"offer first these ladies in exchange for your priest," said glenarvan, pointing to lady helena and mary grant. lady helena</p>
<p>was about to interrupt him. but the ma/"or held her back. "those two ladies," continued glenarvan, bowing respectfully toward lady</p>
<p>helena and mary grant, "are personages of rank in their own country." the warrior gazed coldly at his prisoner. an</p>
<p>evil smile relaxed his lips for a moment; then he controlled himself, and in a voice of ill-concealed anger: "do</p>
<p>you hope to deceive kai-koumou with lying words, accursed pakeka? can not the eyes of kai-koumou read hearts?" and pointing</p>
<p>to lady helena: "that is your wife?" he said. "no! mine.-" exclaimed kara-tete. and then pushing his prisoners aside, he</p>
<p>laid his hand on the shoulder of lady helena, who turned pale at his touch. "edward." cried the unfortunate woman</p>
<p>in terror. glenarvan, without a word, raised his arm, a shot! and kara-tete fell at his feet. the sound brought</p>
<p>a crowd of natives to the spot. a hundred arms were ready, and glenarvan s revolver was snatched from him.</p>
<p>kai-koumou glanced at glenarvan with a curious expression: then with one hand protecting glenarvan, with the other he waved off</p>
<p>the crowd who were rushing on the party. at last his voice was heard above the tumult. "taboo! taboo!" he</p>
<p>shouted. at that word the crowd stood still before glenarvan and his companions, who for the time were preserved by</p>
<p>a supernatural influence. a few minutes after they were re-conducted to ware-atoua, which was their prison. but robert grant and</p>
<p>paganel were not with them. kai-koumou, as frequently happens among the maories, joined the title of ariki to that of</p>
<p>tribal chief. he was invested with the dignity of priest, and, as such, he had the power to throw over</p>
<p>persons or things the superstitious protection of the "taboo." the "taboo," which is common to all the polynesian races, has</p>
<p>the primary effect of isolating the "tabooed" person and preventing the use of "tabooed" things. according to the maori doctrine,</p>
<p>anyone who laid sacrilegious hands on what had been declared "taboo," would be punished with death by the insulted deity,</p>
<p>and even if the god delayed the vindication of his power, the priests took care to accelerate his vengeance. by</p>
<p>the chiefs, the "taboo" is made a political engine, except in some cases, for domestic reasons. for instance, a native</p>
<p>is tabooed for several days when his hair is cut; when he is tattooed; when he is building a canoe,</p>
<p>or a house; when he is seriously ill, and when he is dead. if excessive consumption threatens to exterminate the</p>
<p>fish of a river, or ruin the early crop of sweet potatoes, these things are put under the protection of</p>
<p>the taboo. if a chief wishes to clear his house of hangers-on, he taboos it; if an english trader displeases</p>
<p>him he is tabooed. his interdict has the effect of the old royal "veto." if an obiect is tabooed, no</p>
<p>one can touch it with impunity. when a native is under the interdict, certain aliments are denied him for a</p>
<p>prescribed period. if he is relieved, as regards the severe diet, his slaves feed him with the viands he is</p>
<p>forbidden to touch with his hands; if he is poor and has no slaves, he has to take up the</p>
<p>food with his mouth, like an animal. in short, the most trifling acts of the maories are directed and modified</p>
<p>by this singular custom, the deity is brought into constant contact with their daily life. the taboo has the same</p>
<p>weight as a law; or rather, the code of the maories, indisputable and undisputed, is comprised in the frequent applications</p>
<p>of the taboo. as to the prisoners confined in the ware-atoua, it was an arbitrary taboo which had saved them</p>
<p>from the fury of the tribe. some of the natives, friends and partisans of kai-koumou, desisted at once on hearing</p>
<p>their chief s voice, and protected the captives from the rest. glenarvan cherished no illusive hopes as to his own</p>
<p>fate; nothing but his death could atone for the murder of a chief, and among these people death was only</p>
<p>the concluding act of a martyrdom of torture. glenarvan, therefore, was fully prepared to pay the penalty of the righteous</p>
<p>indignation that nerved his arm, but he hoped that the wrath of kai-koumou would not extend beyond himself. what</p>
