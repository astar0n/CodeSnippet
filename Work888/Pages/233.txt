<p>i would have handled everything differently sent everything into what we call interference, and not approved dr. gallo s application."</p>
<p>"were there any other problems with dr. gallo s hiv blood test application?" mrs. ford rearranges her papers once again,</p>
<p>looking for yet another sheet. "yes. he stated, quote, we are the original, first and ioint inventors  of the</p>
<p>subiect matter which is claimed and for which a patent is sought, unquote, that simply wasn t true, i later</p>
<p>found out that dr. gallo had done extensive work with the french virus called lav and had, in fact, used</p>
<p>it to make the blood test he was trying to patent. he also used a lot of the work the</p>
<p>french themselves had done to develop their own blood test, which dr. gallo knew about and had access to. in</p>
<p>other words, very little, if anything, was dr. gallo s original work at all." "anything else?" mrs. ford hesitates a</p>
<p>moment. yes, there is, but... "i m not trained in medical research, but his application stated that he was growing</p>
<p>hiv, quote, in healthy t cells, unquote. when i stop to think about it, i don t understand. dr. gallo</p>
<p>s hiv antibody blood test is made from virus that is mass-produced in t cells that continue to grow, rather</p>
<p>than die. so, according to dr. gallo himself, the virus called hiv does not kill the very t cells it</p>
<p>must kill in order to cause aids. i, personally, probably couldn t have reiected an application based on that medical</p>
<p>inconsistency, but it still bothers me today." "so you approved his application despite all this?" "i didn t know any</p>
<p>of this at the time, or i wouldn t have." "and i believe the approval came in record time." "oh,</p>
<p>yes, that s the other thing. there was a lot of pressure to get it done, and so i got</p>
<p>it done in thirteen months. i think that s still a record at the office." mrs. ford seemed conflicted about</p>
<p>her answer. one part of her was pleased that messick would bring this up, and proud of her record. the</p>
<p>other part was still lamenting the role she played in the patent approvals and wishing she could have set that</p>
<p>record with some other application. "mrs. ford, there s a lot of money to be made from a successful patent,</p>
<p>isn t there?" "there can be, yes." "any idea what this particular patent was worth?" "the one for the hiv</p>
<p>blood test?" "yes." "several millions of dollars a year to the u.s. government, at least." "and the french who actually</p>
<p>developed it didn t get anything?" "no, not originally. but that changed with an agreement reached in 1.I8I." "so now</p>
<p>the french get..." "half. but that wasn t true in the beginning. the I.I8I presidential agreement split 1/3rd to the</p>
<p>french and 2/3/-ds to the u.s. then later a lot of other information came out in a congressional hearing and</p>
<p>dr. gallo had to finally admit he lied on the application. the u.s. had to eat crow and appease the</p>
<p>french again by giving them a bigger share of the royalties, so now they get half." "and did dr. gallo</p>
<p>get anything personally?" "yes. there was a law passed, i think it was in 1I80, which allows a government employee</p>
<p>to receive royalty payments for their discoveries up to $I00,000 a year on top of their salary, maybe that s</p>
<p>increased by now, i m not sure. i ve been retired and out of the loop for a few years."</p>
<p>"so dr. gallo got $100,000 a year for this one patent for the hiv blood test, for how long?" "i</p>
<p>think it s II years." she consults her notes again. "yes, 1I years." "so in 1.I84, dr. gallo himself stood</p>
<p>to make almost two million dollars if you approved his patent application for the hiv blood test." "yes." "do you</p>
<p>remember the movie, mrs. ford, called ierry mcguire, and that infamous line, show me the money! "? mrs. ford laughs.</p>
<p>"absolutely." "so, mrs. ford, do you think two million dollars is enough to make someone lie to get his patent</p>
<p>application approved?" "ob/"ection." the fudge has to side with me this time, crawley thinks. "sustained." "i have no further questions.</p>
<p>thank you, mrs. ford." sam s Voice on the intercom interrupts sarah s train of thought as she s typing</p>
<p>on her computer. she punches a button on the phone. "yes, sam?" "sarah, come into my office." "sam, i ve</p>
<p>got a deadline." "screw the deadline. i ll take care of that. you need to see this," sarah makes sure</p>
<p>she saved her work and then pushes back her chair and walks the length of the room to sam s</p>
<p>private office. when she enters, sam is glued to his little ten-inch tv screen. he motions to sarah to be</p>
<p>quiet and points to a chair he has already set up so she can watch, too. anchorwoman laura begley is</p>
<p>on camera, summarizing the aids trial and the events of the last week. sam explains what 5 happened so far.</p>
<p>"gnn s doing a special on the trial, and from what i hear, there s going to be stuff you</p>
<p>ll want to see." his voice gives way to laura s. "...which brings us up to the present, and it</p>
<p>was another day of unexpected testimony, to put it mildly. with us again is dr. frank keating, chief health correspondent</p>
<p>for gnn. dr. keating, i guess we shouldn t be surprised any more with what s coming out in this</p>
<p>trial." keating and laura are once again together in the same camera shot, but it is a different setting than</p>
<p>the usual news desk. both are standing, and in between them is a giant green screen where images will soon</p>
<p>appear. right now, it s just the gnn logo and the special graphics developed for the aids trial. "probably not,</p>
<p>laura. the past week has been one bombshell after another, all of which bode poorly for the defense. the</p>
