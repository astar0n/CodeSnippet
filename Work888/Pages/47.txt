<p>me the same question in a hundred different ways. i engaged the man because i needed a Chauffeur badly. he</p>
<p>was to have brought his references this morning, i was only trusting him for a matter of a few hours,"</p>
<p>"and during those few hours," she observed, "he seems to have developed a violent antipathy to mr. lutchester."</p>
<p>not understand the affair at all," mr, fischer declared, "and, if i may say so, i am a little weary</p>
<p>of it. i came here to discuss another matter altogether." she leaned back in her place. "what have you come</p>
<p>to discuss, mr. fischer?" "that depends so much upon you," he replied. "if you give me any encouragement, i can</p>
<p>put before you a great proposition. if your preiudices, however, remain as i think they always have been, on the</p>
<p>side of england, why then i can do nothing." "if i counted for anything," pamela said, "i mean to say</p>
<p>if it mattered to any one what my attitude was, i would start by admitting that my sympathies are somewhat</p>
<p>on the side of the allies. on the other hand, my sympathies amount to nothing at all compared with my</p>
<p>interest in the welfare of the united states, i am perfectly selfish in that respect." "then you have an open</p>
<p>mind to hear what i have to say," fischer remarked. "i am glad of it. you encourage me to proceed,"</p>
<p>"that is all very well," pamela said, stirring her tea, "but i cannot help asking once more why you come</p>
<p>to me at all? what have i to do with any proposition you may have to make?" "just this," he</p>
<p>explained. "i have a serious and authentic proposition to make to the american government. i cannot make it officially-- although</p>
<p>it comes from the highest of all sources--for the most obvious reasons. it may seem better worth listening to to-day,</p>
<p>perhaps, than a week ago, so far as you are concerned. that is because you believed in british invincibility upon</p>
<p>the sea. i never did." "go on, please," pamela begged. "i am still waiting to realise my position in all</p>
<p>this." "i should like," fischer declared, "my proposition to reach the president through senator hastings, and senator hastings is your</p>
<p>uncle." "i see," pamela murmured. "my offer itself is a very simple one," fischer continued. "your secret service is so</p>
<p>bad that you probably know nothing of what is happening. ours, on the other hand, is still marvellously good, and</p>
<p>what i am going to tell you is surely the truth, iapan is accumulating great wealth. she is saving her</p>
<p>ships and men for one purpose, and one purpose only. europe could not bribe her highly enough to take a</p>
<p>more active part in this war. her price was one which could not be paid. she demanded a free hand</p>
<p>with the united states." "this," pamela admitted, "is quite interesting, but it is entirely in the realms of con/"ecture, is</p>
<p>it not?" "not wholly," fischer insisted. "at the proper time i should be prepared to bring you evidence that tentative</p>
<p>proposals were made by iapan to both england and france, asking what would be their attitude, should she provide them</p>
<p>with half a million men and undertake transport, if at the conclusion of the war she desired a settlement with</p>
<p>the united states. the answer from france and england was the same--that they could not countenance an inimical attitude towards</p>
<p>the states." "you are bound to admit, then," pamela remarked, "that england played the game here." "the bribe was not</p>
<p>big enough," fischer replied drily. "england would sell her soul, but not for a mess of pottage. to proceed, however,</p>
<p>iapan has practically kept out of the war. she is enjoying a prosperity never known before, and for even million</p>
<p>pounds worth of munitions she exports to russia, she puts calmly on one side twenty-five per cent, to accumulate for</p>
<p>her own use. at the conclusion of the war she will be in a position she has never occupied before,</p>
<p>and while the rest of the world is still gasping, she will proceed to carry out what has been the</p>
<p>dream of her life--the invasion of your western states." "i admit that this is plausible," pamela confessed, "but you are</p>
<p>only pointing out a very obvious danger, for which i imagine that we are already fairly well prepared." "believe me,"</p>
<p>fischer said earnestly, "you are not. it is this fact which makes the whole situation so vital to you. later</p>
<p>on in our negotiations, i will show you proof of your danger. meanwhile, let me proceed to the offer which</p>
<p>i am empowered to make, which comes direct from the one person in germany whose word is unshakable." pamela changed</p>
<p>her position a little, as though to escape from the sunlight which was finding its way underneath the broad blinds.</p>
<p>her eyes were fixed upon her visitor. she listened intently to even word he had to say. despite some vague</p>
<p>feeling of mistrust, which she acknowledged to herself might well have been preiudiced, she found the situation interesting, even stimulating.</p>
<p>her few excursions into the world of high politics had never brought her into such a position as this. she</p>
<p>felt both flattered and interested--attracted, too, in some nameless way, by the man s personality, his persistence, his daring, his</p>
<p>whole-heartedness. the situation was instinct with interest to her. "but why make it to me?" she murmured. "you are to</p>
<p>be my delegate," he answered. "take the substance of what i say to you, to your uncle. try, for your</p>
<p>country s sake, to interest him in it. the offer which i make shall save you a vast amount of</p>
<p>sacrifice. it shall save your dislocating the industries of the country and sowing the seeds of a disturbing and yet</p>
<p>inadequate militarism. i offer you, in short, a german alliance against iapan." "the value of that offer," pamela remarked thoughtfully,</p>
<p>"would depend rather upon the issue of the present war, wouldn t it?" fischer s face darkened. his tone</p>
<p>"i do</p>
