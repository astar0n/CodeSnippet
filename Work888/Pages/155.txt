<p>addressed the sorcerers, although many of the words she used were not known to me, and the general form of</p>
<p>her language appeared archaic, as for instance that of spenser is compared with modern english. when she saw i did</p>
<p>not comprehend her, however, she would stop and cast her sentences in a different shape, till at length i caught</p>
<p>her meaning. now i give the substance of what she said. "you are safe," she began, glancing first at the</p>
<p>palm ropes that lay upon the rock and then at my wrists, one of which was cut. "yes, lady yva,</p>
<p>thanks to your father." "you should say thanks to me. my father was thinking of other things, but i was</p>
<p>thinking of you strangers, and from where i was i saw those wicked ones coming to kill you." "oh! from</p>
<p>the top of the mountain, i suppose." she shook her head and smiled but vouchsafed no further explanation, unless her</p>
<p>following words can be so called. these were: "i can see otherwise than with my eyes, if i choose." a</p>
<p>statement that caused bickley, who was listening, to mutter: "impossible! what the deuce can she mean? telepathy, perhaps." "i saw,"</p>
<p>she continued, "and told the lord, my father. he came forth. did he kill them? i did not look to</p>
<p>learn." "yes. they lie in the lake, all except three whom he sent away as messengers." "i thought so. death</p>
<p>is terrible, o humphrey, but it is a sword which those, who rule must use to smite the wicked and</p>
<p>the savage. not wishing to pursue this subject, i asked her what her father was doing with the metal plates.</p>
<p>"he reads the stars," she answered, "to learn how long we have been asleep. before we went to sleep he</p>
<p>made two pictures of them, as they were then and as they should be at the time he had set</p>
<p>for our awakening." "we set that time," interrupted bickley. "not so. o bickley," she answered, smiling again. "in the divine</p>
<p>oro s head was the time set. you were the hand that executed his decree." when bickley heard this i</p>
<p>really thought he would have burst. however, he controlled himself nobly, being anxious to hear the end of this mysterious</p>
<p>fib. "how long was the time that the lord oro set apart for sleep?" i asked. she paused as though</p>
<p>puzzled to find words to express her meaning, then held up her hands and said: "ten," nodding at her fingers.</p>
<p>by second thoughts she took bickley s hands, not mine, and counted his ten fingers. "ten years," said bickley. "well,</p>
<p>of course, it is impossible, but perhaps--" and he paused. "ten tens," she went on with a deepening smile, "one</p>
<p>hundred." "o!" said bickley. "ten hundreds, one thousand." "i say!" said bickley. "ten times ten thousand, one hundred thousand." bickley</p>
<p>became silent. "twice one hundred thousand and half a hundred thousand, two hundred and fifty thousand years. that was the</p>
<p>space of time which the lord oro, my father, set for our sleep. whether it has been fulfilled he will</p>
<p>know presently when he has read the book of the stars and made comparison of it with what he wrote</p>
<p>before we laid us down to rest," and she pointed to the metal plates which the ancient was studying. bickley</p>
<p>walked away, making sounds as though he were going to be ill and looking so absurd in his indignation that</p>
<p>i nearly laughed. the lady yva actually did laugh, and very musical was that laugh. "he does not believe," she</p>
<p>said. "he is so clever he knows everything. but two hundred and fifty thousand years ago we should have thought</p>
<p>him quite stupid. then we could read the stars and calculate their movements for ever." "so can we," i answered,</p>
<p>rather nettled. "i am glad, o humphrey, since you will be able to show my father if in one of</p>
<p>them he is wrong." secretly i hoped that this task would not be laid on me. indeed, i thought it</p>
<p>well to change the subject for the edification of bickley who had recovered and was drawn back by his eager</p>
<p>curiosity. /"ust then, too, bastin ioined us, happy in his regained boots. "you tell us, lady yva," i said, "that</p>
<p>you slept, or should have slept for two hundred and fifty thousand years." here bastin opened his eyes. "if that</p>
<p>was so, where was your mind all this time?" "if by my mind you mean spirit, 0 humphrey, i have</p>
<p>to answer that at present i do not know for certain. i think, however, that it dwelt elsewhere, perhaps in</p>
<p>other bodies on the earth, or some different earth. at least, i know that my heart is very full of</p>
<p>memories which as yet i cannot unroll and read." "great heavens, this is madness!" said bickley. "in the great heavens,"</p>
<p>she answered slowly, "there are many things which you, poor man, would think to be madness, but yet are truth</p>
<p>and perfect wisdom. these things, or some of them, soon i shall hope to show you." "do if you can,"</p>
<p>said bickley. "why not?" interrupted bastin. "i think the lady s remarks quite reasonable. it seems to me highly improbable</p>
<p>if really she has slept for two hundred and fifty thousand years, which, of course, i can t decide, that</p>
<p>an immortal spirit would be allowed to remain idle for so long. that would be wallowing in a bed of</p>
<p>idleness and shirking its duty which is to do its work. also, as she tells you, bickley, you are not</p>
<p>half so clever as you think you are in your silly scepticism, and i have no doubt that there are</p>
<p>many things in other worlds which would expose your ignorance, if only you could see them." at this moment oro</p>
<p>turned and called his daughter. she went at once, saying: "come, strangers, and you shall learn." so we followed her.</p>
<p>"daughter," he said, speaking in orofenan, i think that we might understand, "ask these strangers to bring one of</p>
