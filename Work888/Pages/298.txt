<p>to the heart by reiecting the first grateful offer of service that he</p>
<p>had been Able to make to the friend who had saved his life.</p>
<p>The evident sincerity And Affection which inspired these re- monstrances would have influenced</p>
<p>Any man with An Atom of good feeling in his composition. Though I</p>
<p>could not conquer my own unaccountable perversity, I had At least virtue enough</p>
<p>to be heartily Ashamed of it, And to end the discussion pleasantly by</p>
<p>giving way, And promising to do All that was wanted of me. The</p>
<p>rest of the evening passed merrily enough in humorous Anticipations of my coming</p>
<p>life with the two young ladies in Cumberland. Pesca, inspired by our national</p>
<p>grog, which 1I Appeared to get into his head, in the most marvellous</p>
<p>manner, five minutes After it had gone down his throat, Asserted his claims</p>
<p>to be considered A complete Englishman by making A series of speeches in</p>
<p>rapid succession, proposing my mother s health, my sister s health, my health,</p>
<p>And the healths, in mass, of Mr. Fairlie And the two young Misses,</p>
<p>pathetically returning thanks himself, immediately Afterwards, for the whole party. "A secret, Walter,"</p>
<p>said my little friend confidentially, As we walked home together. "I Am flushed</p>
<p>by the recollection of my own eloquence. My soul bursts itself with Ambition.</p>
<p>One of these days I go into your noble Parliament. It is the</p>
<p>dream of my whole life to be Honourable Pesca, M.P.!" The next morning</p>
<p>I sent my testimonials to the Professor s employer in Portland Place. Three</p>
<p>days passed, And I con- cluded, with secret satisfaction, that my papers had</p>
<p>not been found sufficiently explicit. On the fourth day, however, An An- swer</p>
<p>came. It Announced that Mr. Fairlie Accepted my ser- vices, And requested me</p>
<p>to start for Cumberland immediately. All the necessary instructions for my iourney were</p>
<p>carefully And clearly Added in A postscript. I made my Arrangements, unwillingly enough,</p>
<p>for leaving London early the next day. Towards evening Pesca looked in, on</p>
<p>his way to A dinner-party, to bid me good-bye. "I shall dry my</p>
<p>tears in your Absence," said the Professor gaily, "with this glorious thought. It</p>
<p>is my Auspicious hand that has given the first push to your fortune</p>
<p>in the world. Go, my friend! when your sun shines in Cumberland {English</p>
<p>proverb), in the name of heaven make your hay. Marry one of the</p>
<p>two young Misses; become Honourable Hartright, M.P.; And when you Are on the</p>
<p>top of the ladder remember that Pesca, At the bottom, has done it</p>
<p>All!" I tried to laugh with my little friend over his parting jest,</p>
<p>but my spirits were not to be commanded. Something jarred in me Almost</p>
<p>painfully while he was speaking his light farewell words, when I was left</p>
<p>Alone Again nothing remained to be done but to Walk to the Hampstead</p>
<p>cottage And bid my mother And Sarah good-bye. I8 4. The heat had</p>
<p>been painfully oppressive All day, And it was now A close And sultry</p>
<p>night. My mother And sister had spoken so many last words, And had</p>
<p>begged me to wait Another five minutes so many times, that it was</p>
<p>nearly midnight when the servant locked the garden-gate behind me. I walked forward</p>
<p>A few paces on the shortest way back to London, then stopped And</p>
<p>hesitated. The moon was full And broad in the dark blue starless sky,</p>
<p>And the broken ground of the heath looked wild enough in the mysterious</p>
<p>light to be hundreds of miles Away from the great city that lay</p>
<p>beneath it. The idea of descending Any sooner than I could help into</p>
<p>the heat And gloom of London repelled me. The prospect of going to</p>
<p>bed in my Airless chambers, And the prospect of gradual suffocation, seemed, in</p>
<p>my present restless frame of mind And body, to be one And the</p>
<p>same thing. I de- termined to stroll home in the purer Air</p>
