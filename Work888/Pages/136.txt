<p>that s just how much we want. if You have to communicate with us, address t. l. meredith, box 11I.</p>
<p>better send your looter in cipher. here s a little code i worked out that we sometimes use. well, so-long.</p>
<p>good hunting, lieutenant." fraser nodded farewell, but did not offer to shake hands. brandt lingered for an instant. "don t</p>
<p>make any mistake, fraser, about this rob you ve bit off. it s a big one, and don t you</p>
<p>forget it. people are sore on me because i have fallen down on it. i can t help it. i</p>
<p>just can t get the evidence. if you tackle it, you ll be in danger from start to finish. there</p>
<p>are some bad men in this country, and the worst of them are lying low in lost valley." the ranger</p>
<p>smiled amiably. "where is this lost valley?" "somewhere up in the cedar mountain district. i ve never been there. few</p>
<p>men have, for it is not easy to find." and even if it were strangers are not invited." "well, i</p>
<p>ll have to invite myself." "that s all right. but remember this. there are men up there who would drill</p>
<p>holes in a dying man. i guess lost valley is the country god forgot." "sounds right interesting." "you ll find</p>
<p>it all that, and don t forget that if they find out what you are doing there, it will be</p>
<p>god help steve fraser!" the ranger s eyes gleamed. "i ll try to remember it." it was one-twenty when fraser</p>
<p>slipped the iron bar from the masonry into which it had been fixed and began to lower himself from the</p>
<p>window. the back of the fail faced on the bank of a creek; and into the aspens, which ran along</p>
<p>it at this point in a little grove, the fugitive pushed his way. he descended to the creek edge and</p>
<p>crossed the mountain stream on bowlders which filled its bed. from here he followed the trail for a hundred yards</p>
<p>that led up the little river. on the Way he passed a boy fishing and nodded a greeting to him,</p>
<p>"what time is it, mister?" the Y%ungster asked. a glance at his watch showed the texan that it was one-twenty-five.</p>
<p>"the fish have quit biting. blame it all, i m going home. say, mister, iimmie spence says they re going</p>
<p>to lynch that fellow who killed billy faulkneru going to hang him to-night, iimmie says, do you reckon they will?"</p>
<p>"no, i reckon not." "tha s what i told him, but iimmie says he heard tom peake say so. iimmie</p>
<p>says this town will be full 0 folks by night." without waiting to hear any more of iimmie s prophecies,</p>
<p>fraser followed the trail till it reached a waterfall brandt bad mentioned, then struck sharply to the right. in a</p>
<p>little bunch of scrub oaks he found a saddled horse tied to a sapling. his instructions were to cross the</p>
<p>road, which ran parallel with the stream, and follow the gulch that led to the river. half an hour s</p>
<p>travel brought him to another road. into this he turned, and followed it. in a desperate hurry though he was,</p>
<p>steve dared not show it. he held his piebald broncho to the ambling trot a cowpony naturally drops into. from</p>
<p>his coat pocket he flashed a mouthharp for use in emergency. presently he met three men riding into town. they</p>
<p>nodded at him, in the friendly, casual way of the outdoors west. the gait of the pony was a leisurely</p>
<p>walk, and its rider was industriously executing, "i met my love in the alamo." "going the wrong way, aren t</p>
<p>you?" one of the three suggested. "don t you worry, i ll be there when y u hang that guy</p>
<p>they caught last night," he told them with a grin. from time to time he met others. all travel seemed</p>
<p>to be headed townward. there was excitement in the air. in the clear atmosphere voices carried a long way, and</p>
<p>all the conversation that came to him was on the subiects of the war for the range, the battle of</p>
<p>the previous evening, and the lynching scheduled to take place in a few hours. he realized that he had escaped</p>
<p>none too soon, for it was certain that as the crowd in town multiplied, they would set a watch on</p>
<p>the fail to prevent brandt from slipping out with his prisoner. about four miles from town he cut the telephone</p>
<p>wires, for he knew that as soon as his escape became known to the iailer, the sheriff would be notified,</p>
<p>and he would telephone in even direction the escape of his prisoner, /"ust the same as if there had been</p>
<p>no arrangement between them. it was certain, too, that all the roads leading from gimlet butte would be followed and</p>
<p>patrolled immediately. for which reason he left the road after cutting the wires, and took to the hill trail marked</p>
<p>out for him in the map furnished by brandt. by night, he was far up in the foothills. close to</p>
<p>a running stream, he camped in a little, grassy park, where his pony could find forage. brandt had stuffed his</p>
<p>saddlebags with food, and had tied behind a sack, with a feed or two of oats for his horse. fraser</p>
<p>had ridden the range too many years to risk lighting a fire, even though he had put thirty-five miles between</p>
<p>him and gimlet butte. the night was chill, as it always is in that altitude, but he rolled up in</p>
<p>his blanket, got what sleep he could, and was off again by daybreak. before noon he was high in the</p>
<p>mountain passes, from which he could sometimes look down into the green parks where nested the little ranches of small</p>
<p>cattlemen, he knew now that he was beyond the danger of the first hurried pursuit, and that it was more</p>
<p>than likely that any of these mountaineers would hide him rather than give him up. nevertheless, he had no</p>
