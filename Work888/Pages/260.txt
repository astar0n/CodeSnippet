<p>i don t earn enough. bridget s mum says we could live with her." he stopped there and iosef waited</p>
<p>to see if he would go on. when he didn t iosef said, "will you auction the house?" "detective," he</p>
<p>struggled for josef s name. "/"osef," iosef offered. "/"osef," he said, "the only thing i have." he corrected himself, reaching</p>
<p>out to touch his wife s shoulder, "we have, is our kids. there s an estate agent coming to look</p>
<p>around this afternoon, he s a friend of my boss s and he says he ll do it for free</p>
<p>and he ll really push for a good price at auction. he s gonna make sure everyone knows why we</p>
<p>re selling and that we need the money. we re gonna do it saturday and i can call the bank</p>
<p>man and he ll fix the money even though the bank is shut." mrs. collridge put down the bowl and</p>
<p>spoon and turned to face iosef. "i m -"0ff.V," iosef offered. "i know," she said, her eyes still full of</p>
<p>tears. "we think it s fantastic what you re doing," whitlock said. "we know you d do anything to get</p>
<p>bryan back. ?o would we, and believe me when i say we re doing everything we can. we re gonna</p>
<p>get this guy and nail his balls to the wall." ?omehoW, fosef thought, she made the words ?ound sympathetic and</p>
<p>threatening at the same time. he wondered what crisis management training was. they sat together in silence for a while.</p>
<p>"where is the pc we left on watch?" /"osef asked. "upstairs in the kid s bedroom," mr. collridge said. "he</p>
<p>said you told him to watch the street." "i did," iosef said and got up. "i ll just check in</p>
<p>on him." iosef found the pc sitting on the bed with a small pair of binoculars and a note pad.</p>
<p>"what ve you got?" he asked. "about twenty five .I0 far," the pc said. "can i have them?" the officer</p>
<p>tore several pages from his notebook. iosef added them to the pages he d got from the martins . "thanks,"</p>
<p>he said, "keep it up." they left the collridges and phoned bentworth on his mobile. he picked up on the</p>
<p>third ring. there was ?ome muffled talking in the background and the ?ound of a door. "go on," bentworth said,</p>
<p>"make it quick though i ve just stepped out of a meeting." "from what the parents say it looks like</p>
<p>the football scout is the prime suspect our end. what does the club say?" "they say their football scouts don</p>
<p>t work like that, almost no one s do," bentworth said, "and if we mention their name they ll sue,</p>
<p>?o don t." "did they come up with a picture yet?" "no," bentworth seemed agitated. "the artist drew two pictures</p>
<p>the boy described as a good likeness, but they Were totally different. i think the best we can reliably do</p>
<p>is white male 35 to 50. they re trying the kid now with photofit but we re not holding out</p>
<p>much hope." "shit," /osef said. "matches the profile though." "what re you doing now?" he asked. it was the question</p>
<p>iosef had hoped to answer with this call but hadn t. "we need to confirm ?omething with the football coach</p>
<p>then i suppose a trip to central park and a shit load of questions." "the football coach is the pe</p>
<p>teacher isn t he?" bentworth asked. "no luck with the picture then," whitlock said. "kid can t give a proper</p>
<p>description, keeps changing it." "you don t think he s lying though?" "nah, it s /"ust harder than it looks,"</p>
<p>iosef said. "what now?" whitlock asked. "it s a five minute walk from here to central park, shall we leave</p>
<p>the car here?" he asked. "yeah," whitlock said. "are we really gonna hang around the park the rest of the</p>
<p>afternoon asking questions?" "of course not," iosef said smiling. "/ust while i m figuring out the next step," "let s</p>
<p>take the car then." whitlock laughed holding out her hand, palm up. "looks like rain." after /ust twenty minutes in</p>
<p>the park it had started to rain. the few kids that were there went home ?o /"osef and whitlock retreated</p>
<p>to the car. /osef checked his watch. "i think probably the most productive thing we can do is pass the</p>
<p>martins and the beachams on the way in, go through those registration numbers. maybe we ll turn ?omething up." "okay,</p>
<p>anything s worth a try." it was after six by the time they d gone through the fifty or ?o</p>
<p>registration numbers collected. iosef drew the short straw and typed up their notes while whitlock looked. nothing appeared on more</p>
<p>than one list. when they d finished iosef fetched coffee from the canteen. ma?on hadn t appeared back in cid.</p>
<p>he d gone straight to the public appeal. iosef conceded that he was lead detective and should be there ?o</p>
<p>he grudgingly photocopied his notes and left the copy on ma?on s desk. "i don t know about you," /osef</p>
<p>said, "but i m starved." whitlock examined her coffee cup. "i ve got to go home," she said. "okay, i</p>
<p>ll see you here in the morning for briefing," iosef said. he wasn t actually sure he d been turned</p>
<p>down, because he hadn t actually asked, but they both knew he was going to. he decided she meant don</p>
<p>t ask , which was fine. she got up and headed for the door. "night mary," he said. "close," she</p>
<p>called, but he couldn t see her face. iosef sat at the desk for a long time, leaning back in</p>
<p>the chair his feet on the desk, his eyes on the ceiling. he fell asleep. iosef woke about nine slumped</p>
<p>across his desk. his cheek was wet and he couldn t even move his right arm. it fell lamely off</p>
<p>the desk as he sat up. he tried his fingers but they didn t move and checked his watch,</p>
