<p>the announcer s desk. he picked it up, glanced at it, then said "this is a special news flash. a</p>
<p>small cargo boat has gone missing, it was sailing from london to barrow in furness. it has not arrived at</p>
<p>its destination and no trace if it has been found. it did not send any distress messages. the ship is</p>
<p>called whirlwind , it was carrying spare parts for nuclear submarines. wait a moment." as he spoke, anohure piece of</p>
<p>paper was put in front of him. he read it through, and then, looking very grave, said. "this message has</p>
<p>been given to us, and it says that the ship has been hiiacked, and we have a demand for ten</p>
<p>million pounds for its safe return. the terrorists, whoever they are also say that they have a weapon that controls</p>
<p>minds within a 20 miles range, so nobody can approach them. they say it will be switched on if any</p>
<p>action is taken against them. the ransom must be paid within two days. details of how it is to be</p>
<p>paid will follow, please do not panic, we will keep you informed with any further developments as they come in"</p>
<p>as his voice droned on, robin nudged robina, and then went out. robina followed, and when they were alone in</p>
<p>the garden robin said. "i bet that the ship we saw hidden in the cove is the one that has</p>
<p>been hiiacked". "how can we be sure?" asked robina, worried that they could make a terrible mistake, and cause the</p>
<p>device to be switched on. "we ll go tonight when it s dark, and its bound to have a name</p>
<p>painted on it. if it is the ship, we can call rhes on the medallion, and he can save the</p>
<p>people," replied robin. just as they returned to the house, they heard lofty tell amy that they were going out,</p>
<p>and would be late back. after they had gone, the twins watched television until it was dark. with a yawn</p>
<p>and a stretch, robin pretended that he was tired, and told mohure that he was going to bed. robina waited</p>
<p>a few moments, then followed. as she went up stairs the telephone rang, she heard the murmur of voices, and</p>
<p>as she heard the phone being put down. mohure called up to say that she and amy were just going</p>
<p>down the road to see a friend who needed help with some curtains she was making, and they would be</p>
<p>back later. no sooner had the door shut, than the twins were on the landing. "what a wonderful opportunity" said</p>
<p>robin, "we can go to the cove, check on the ship s name, and be back before mohure and amy</p>
<p>come home." they grabbed torches, iumped onto their bikes and tore off to the cliffs over the cove. when they</p>
<p>reached the path down to the ship, they could show no lights, because there might be a look out, so</p>
<p>they picked their way very carefully down the steep path, stopping when a cloud covered the moon, knowing that a</p>
<p>slip would send them over the edge to a certain death on the rocks far beneath their feet. after a</p>
<p>time that seemed an age, but was only a few moments, the twins reached the bottom of the path, and</p>
<p>stood safely on the rocks, and in front of them loomed the black sharpe of the ship. the netting hung</p>
<p>from the masts, looking large in the moonlight. robin whispered that he would look for the name on one end,</p>
<p>while robina looked on the ohure. that way they would save precious time. robina nodded, and then suggested that they</p>
<p>meet again in five minutes, at the same place. robina walked slowly along with just a flash of her torch</p>
<p>now and then, between her fingers, to show her the way. she found the end of the netting, and lifted</p>
<p>it up. inside the net she saw the ship s side, and as she shone her torch up. the name</p>
<p>was not quite in view. she was just about to step back to where she could read it, when a</p>
<p>hard hand came from behind her and grabbed the torch. anohure hand fastened across her mouth. she tried to scream,</p>
<p>but couldn t make a sound. "what have we here?" asked a harsh voice from behind her. without being given</p>
<p>a chance to say anything, she was dragged along the rocks to the gangway that led up to the deck.</p>
<p>how she struggled. she kicked and tried to get loose, but it was no use. at last she managed to</p>
<p>bite the hand that was over her mouth, and as it was ierked aside, she screamed as loud as she</p>
<p>could. the man holding her let out a curse, and hit her hard on the side of the head. "that</p>
<p>will teach you not to bite". he said angrily as he dragged her to the foot af the gangway. robin</p>
<p>had heard her scream, and appeared out of the darkness like a wild thing. he took the man by surprising</p>
<p>and had almost got robina away, when the man grabbed him by the hair. the noise had alarmed the ohure</p>
<p>villains on the ship, and it only took a few seconds for them to come and help. the twins were</p>
<p>bundled up the gangway and onto the ship, through a door, and into a brightly lit cabin. once they were</p>
<p>in the room, the door was slammed shut behind them, and they saw that there was no escape. as they</p>
<p>stood there, panting, they saw, sitting in a chair, smoking his pipe, the older man who had shouted at charlie</p>
<p>at the field where the hang gliders were. for a moment the twins stared at the villain seated in front</p>
<p>of them. charlie, the young pilot, moved as if to step forward, but as he did so, footsteps clattered on</p>
<p>the deck outside, and the door crashed open. charlie stood still, and the twins spun round, alarmed to see</p>
