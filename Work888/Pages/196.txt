<p>procedures. if you and your boys don t do this clean, it s going to mean our next command, yours</p>
<p>and mine, will be somewhere within sight of tierra del fuego. if there s a nuclear incident here, the greek</p>
<p>government would probably tear up our mutual-defense treaty and convert the base at souda into a souvlaki stand. am i</p>
<p>making myself clear?" "if i hear you right, what you re saying is, no way can we afford to fuck</p>
<p>this one up." "i ve always admired your quick grasp of the salient points in a briefing. so, we re</p>
<p>going to do this by the goddamn book; we re going to dot every goddamn i and cross every goddamn</p>
<p>t and get every goddamn detail of this op, right down to the color of our goddamn shoelaces, approved, signed</p>
<p>off, and ass-kissed in triplicate. that iranian hostage disaster did not exactly make a lot of careers. again i ask</p>
<p>you, eric, am i getting the fuck through?" "in skywriting, the only small problem i see, sir, is that while</p>
<p>everybody is carefully protecting their pension, those assholes on the island may start slaughtering hostages, or put this nuclear material</p>
<p>-which i have just learned about in such a timely fashion-into goddamn orbit. and then my deltas are going to</p>
<p>be in the middle of a shitstorm they easily could have prevented if they d been given the chance. they</p>
<p>re my boys, and i don t really take kindly to that happening. sir." he reached in his breast pocket</p>
<p>for a cigar, the chewing of which was his usual response to stress. "so what exactly do you propose we</p>
<p>do?" austin asked. "the most obvious first thing would be to interdict this bunch of mercenary ierkoffs and keep them</p>
<p>from going in there and getting a lot of people killed. i say we should find them and stop them,</p>
<p>using whatever force it takes. there are enough civilians in harm s way as it is," he leaned forward. "look,</p>
<p>if we have to dick around waiting on the pentagon before we can go in, at least we can stop</p>
<p>these mercenary assholes. it has to be done. and we don t need some computer study before we get off</p>
<p>our ass. i want to take them down, and nobody has to even know about it. if it comes out</p>
<p>in some debriefing someday, we ll worry about it then." "all right, maybe i agree with you," austin sighed. "they</p>
<p>should be interdicted. what do you want? a pave-low?" "just give me an sh-60. to pick them up. i m</p>
<p>going to put the love of the lord into these amateurs, then bring them in. hell, they re probably well-intentioned,</p>
<p>just doing what somebody paid them to do." and who could blame that somebody, he found himself thinking, if it</p>
<p>takes the u.s. of a. this long to cut through its damned bureaucracy and mount an operation, "all right, i</p>
<p>ll give you a seahawk," austin said. "it can be prepped and ready to go by"-he glanced at his watch-"D300</p>
<p>hours. will that be enough?" "guess it ll have to be." by that time, he was thinking ruefully, we could</p>
<p>be taking the island. and with that thought he decided to hell with protocol and fired up his well-chewed cigar.</p>
<p>"look, eric, i know what you re thinking," austin said after a pause, "that an old fart like me is</p>
<p>cramping your guys style. and, dammit, maybe there s a grain of truth in that- hell, more than a grain,</p>
<p>but here s the downside. if your deltas go in half-cocked and get cut up, we re going to get</p>
<p>blamed. on the other hand, if they don t go in till washington says so, then, yes, maybe it ll</p>
<p>be too late, but it s going to be on somebody else s service record, not ours. i m protecting</p>
<p>your boys, whether you see it or not. if we only go in on orders, then the deltas are not</p>
<p>going to be the ones taking the heat if this thing falls apart." "/"ust get me the damned chopper," nichols</p>
<p>said quietly. mannheim looked at her. "cally, we need to try and find him. this vance fellow. if his friends</p>
<p>are going to try and come in, then they ll need him to help them. he ll know what they</p>
<p>require a lot better than you will." she found herself nodding grimly, agreeing. isaac mannheim was no dummy, "they must</p>
<p>either have captured him or shot him," she said. "or both. he would have come back by now unless there</p>
<p>was a problem. but if he s still alive, then they probably have him down at launch. and it s</p>
<p>going to be very dangerous for us to go down there, isaac." "i m an old man. maybe i ve</p>
<p>outlived my usefulness." it was strange talk for isaac mannheim, but he was turning wistful, perhaps even defeated. "i do</p>
<p>know one thing. he risked his life for me. i owe it to him to at least find out what</p>
<p>happened. so let me go by myself." she did not like the sound of that. "look, maybe i-" "no, not</p>
<p>you. they ve got to be looking for you. but they probably just think i m an old fool"-he laughed-"and</p>
<p>maybe they re right. at any rate, at least i can go down there and wander around a bit. everybody</p>
<p>knows i m harmless. as long as it doesn t look like i m going anywhere, i don t think</p>
<p>they ll bother with me. at least not right now. if they re busy with the countdown, they re not</p>
<p>going to trouble with a deranged old man. i m small potatoes." "isaac, you re a very big potato." she</p>
<p>wanted to hug him. "but you re also just about the most wonderful man i know. i love you to</p>
<p>death. just be careful, please?" now it was his turn to smile, the old face showing its wrinkles more</p>
