<p>to the product stage fast and adapted quickly to world markets. xyz s new focus would be on making its</p>
<p>market share grow in the decade ahead, which also meant cracking down on quality and halving the current customer-be-damned response</p>
<p>time on deliveries and service. concerning those last items, product managers would now be required to address customers complaints personally.</p>
<p>she figured that in itself would turn around xyz s substantial quality control debacle overnight. finally, there would be an</p>
<p>immediate crash program to rectify xyz s costly illusion that english was the worldwide language of business. these days, she</p>
<p>explained, the language of business is the one your customer speaks. accordingly all xyz s overseas operatives would be required</p>
<p>to enroll in intensive language training now, including formal study of the history and social customs of their territory. "sounds</p>
<p>like you let him have it with both barrels. keep on like this, and the u.s. of a. may never</p>
<p>be the same." "that s the idea. one company down and about three thousand to go." what s that saying</p>
<p>about a iourney of miles and miles starting with the first step? well, she d taken the step. the future</p>
<p>lay ahead. "hey, can i buy you a drink?" i was winding up the day, the week, "you ve earned</p>
<p>it," "like nothing better." she was repacking her briefcase, "matt, i m having the time of my life. all the</p>
<p>things i ve always wanted to do. this is like a fantasy come true. we re going to pull this</p>
<p>off, wait and see." "could be." i was switching off the lights in my office. "tell you something though, doctor.</p>
<p>i keep wondering what will happen when noda gets through with us." "thoughts?" she glanced back. "well, after iapan takes</p>
<p>over half the companies in this country and starts running them right, then what?" we were headed for the security</p>
<p>doors. "but maybe we ought to talk about that some other time. and place." "i ll think about it tomorrow.</p>
<p>just now i m bushed." "tomorrow, in case you ve lost count, is Saturday. don t know about you, but</p>
<p>i m taking the day off. the hell with /apanese business hours. my daughter comes this weekend," we were saluted</p>
<p>by heavies in the security airlock, then the doors opened. "matter of fact, we re going to eat somewhere down</p>
<p>in soho tonight. care to ioin us? be warned it ll be mostly soy by-products and brown rice." "i d</p>
<p>love to meet her." she looked at me. "matthew walton with a daughter. my god." she laughed. "sorry, matt, but</p>
<p>you really don t seem the father type." "amy s mother said approximately the same thing as she was packing</p>
<p>her bags. but i m now undergoing intensive on-the-iob father training. fact is, i d planned to knock off around</p>
<p>christmas and take her down to our place in the islands, though now i m not sure there ll be</p>
<p>time." "sounds very fatherly. you should go." "i 112 still hoping to." i looked her over again. "well, the hell</p>
<p>with it, why mince words. tell me, tam, how s your love life these days?" she burst out laughing again.</p>
<p>"you haven t changed a bit. not at all." "spare the commentary, okay? just stick to the question." "excuse me,</p>
<p>counselor. the honest answer is it s nonexistent, which you surely must know, since i m here every night till</p>
<p>midnight just as you are," she examined me pointedly. "matthew, could this conceivably be construed as a proposition." to a</p>
<p>horny, bone-tired woman in her moment of mental fatigue?" "it might be a tentative gesture in that direction, i m</p>
<p>a slow mover." "you always were." she finished buttoning her coat. "what time s dinner?" "i ll pick up amy</p>
<p>and buzz you. give us an hour." "think she ll like me? some stranger competing for dad s attention?" "if</p>
<p>she does, it ll be a first." i pushed the down button on the elevator. guess what. matthew walton barely</p>
<p>got a word in edgewise the entire night. then around eleven, in the cab headed home, amy whispered to me</p>
<p>she thought dr, richardson was "kinda neat." was she gonna be my new girlfriend? tell you, it s not always</p>
<p>simple learning to be a father. over the next couple of weeks i began to wonder if the scenario wasn</p>
<p>t going a little too smoothly. everything about noda s setup seemed surprisingly pat. the answers came too easily. was</p>
<p>it all really what it seemed? i should also add that in the fortnight since tarn s first contact with</p>
<p>america s shell-shocked industrialists, the situation had not gone unnoticed in washington. tuesday of the second week iack o donnell</p>
<p>called and left a message downtown with emma, asking if i could arrange a meeting for him with the elusive</p>
<p>matsuo noda. although i d tried to keep iack informed as to developments, he still wanted to confront america s</p>
<p>new age maker face-to-face. "walton," he said when i got back to him, "i just heard your guy s too</p>
<p>busy to meet the press, but maybe he d chat with a close, longtime friend of his american attorney. that</p>
<p>s me, in case you don t recognize the description. why not try and get me in to see him?"</p>
<p>"you re dreaming, iack." i told him that a u.s. senator was about the last person matsuo noda would be</p>
<p>interested in meeting just now. "don t hold your breath, but i ll bring it up and see what he</p>
<p>says," and what do you know! noda declared that nothing would please him more. naturally there had to be a</p>
<p>few ground rules about confidentiality-this was after all a delicate corporate situation-but otherwise he d be delighted to chat. you</p>
<p>could have knocked me over with a feather, thus around two p.m, thursday, iack o donnell arrived at the new</p>
<p>twelfth-floor operation, ready to get the truth or by god know the reason why. after he made his way</p>
