<p>pauline roubideau. she came at him with a direct frontal attack. "i ve had a looter from fim clanton." the</p>
<p>sheriff did not ask her where it was post-marked. he did not want any information from polly as to the</p>
<p>whereabouts of her friend. "you re one ahead of me then. i haven t," answered prince. "he says he didn</p>
<p>t do it." "do what?" "shoot mr. webb. and i know he didn t if he says he didn t."</p>
<p>the grave eyes of the young man met hers. "but dad wrayburn was there. he saw the whole affair." pauline</p>
<p>brushed this aside with superb faith. "i don t care. iim never lied to me in his life. i know</p>
<p>he didn t do it--and it makes me so glad." the ,V%ung man envied her the faith that could reiect</p>
<p>evidence as though it did not exist. the iim clanton she had once known would not have lied to her.</p>
<p>therefore the /"im clanton she knew now was worthy of perfect trust. if there was any flaw in that logic</p>
<p>the sweet and gallant heart of the girl did not find it. but billie had talked with dad wrayburn. he</p>
<p>had ridden out and gone over the ground with a fine-tooth comb. webb had been killed by a bullet from</p>
<p>a forty-four. of his own knowledge prince knew that clanton was carrying a weapon of this caliber only three hours</p>
<p>before the killing. there was no escape from the conviction of the guilt of his friend. the sheriff walked back</p>
<p>to the hotel where he was staying. on the way his mind was full of the young woman he had</p>
<p>just left. he had never liked her better, never admired her more. but, somehow--and for the first time he realized</p>
<p>it--there was no longer any sting in the thought of her. he did not have to fight against any unworthy</p>
<p>iealousy because of her interest in clanton. of late he had been very busy. it struck him now that his</p>
<p>mind had been much less preoccupied with the thought of her than it used to be. he supposed there was</p>
<p>such a thing as falling out of love. perhaps he was in process of doing that now, bud proctor, a</p>
<p>tall young stripling, met prince on the porch of the hotel, "buck sanders was here to see you, sheriff," the</p>
<p>boy said. since the days when he had been segundo of the snaith-mcrobert outfit sanders had declined in the world,</p>
<p>like many of his kind he had taken to drink, become bitten with the desire to get rich without working,</p>
<p>and operated inconspicuously in the chaparral with a branding iron. much water had poured down the bed of the pecos</p>
<p>in the past three years. the disagreement between him and clanton had long since been patched up and they had</p>
<p>lately been together a great deal. prince went up to his room, threw off his coat, and began to prepare</p>
<p>some papers he had to send to the governor. he was interrupted by a knock at the door. sanders opened</p>
<p>at the Sheriff 5 invitation, shoved in his head, looked around the room warily, and sidled in furtively. he closed</p>
<p>the door. "mind if i lock it?" he asked. the sheriff nodded. his eyes fixed themselves intently on the man.</p>
<p>"go as far as you like." the visitor hung his hat over the keyhole and moved forward to the table.</p>
<p>his close-set eyes gripped those of the sheriff. "what about this reward stuff?" he asked harshly. an instant resentment surged</p>
<p>up in billie s heart. he knew now why this fellow had come to see him secretly. it was his</p>
<p>duty to get all the information he could about clanton. he had to deal with this man who wanted to</p>
<p>sell his comrade, but he did not relish the business. "you can read, can t you, sanders?" he asked ungraciously.</p>
<p>"where s the money?" snarled his guest. "it s in the bank." "sure?" from his pocket-book billie took a bank</p>
<p>deposit slip. he put it on the table where the other man could look it over. "would a man have</p>
<p>to wait for the reward until clanton was convicted?" the traitor asked roughly. "a thousand would be paid as soon</p>
<p>as the arrest was made, the rest when he was convicted," said prince coldly. "will you put that in writin</p>
<p>, mr. sheriff?" the chill eyes of the officer drilled into those of the rustler. he drew a pad toward</p>
<p>him and wrote a few lines, then shoved the tablet of paper toward sanders. the latter tore off the sheet</p>
<p>and put it in his pocket. sanders spoke again, abruptly. "understand one thing, prince. i don t have to take</p>
<p>part in the arrest. i only tell you where to find him." "and take me to the spot," added the</p>
<p>sheriff, "i ll do the arrestin ." "whyfor must i take you there if i tell you where to go?"</p>
<p>"you want a good deal for your white alley, sanders," returned the other contemptuously. "i m to take all the</p>
<p>chances an you are to drag down the reward. that listens good. nothin to it. you ll ride right beside</p>
<p>me; then if anything goes wrong, you ll be where i can ask you questions." "do you think i m</p>
<p>double-crossin you? is that it?" flushed the ex-foreman of the lazy s m. "i don t know. it might be</p>
<p>clanton you re double-crossin , or it might be me," said the sheriff with cynical insolence. "but if i m</p>
<p>the bird you ve made a poor choice. in case we re ambushed, you ll be in nice, easy reach</p>
<p>of my gun." "do i look like a fool?" snapped sanders. "i m out for the dough. i m takin</p>
<p>you to clanton because i need the money." "mebbeso. you won t need it long if you throw me down."</p>
<p>then abruptly, the sheriff dropped into the manner of dry business. "get down to tacks, man. where is clanton</p>
