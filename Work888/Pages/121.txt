<p>on both sides of the room. marcia attempts to sweep stephen through the room quickly. a old man in a</p>
<p>tam raises his cup, "huzzah, the man of the hour!" all in the room turn toward stephen who frowns. "he</p>
<p>is here. the man who will open thrycion to us!" others now close in closer to stephen and marcia, expectant.</p>
<p>stephen realizes they are waiting for him to speak. "thank you, thank you, everyone. it is wonderful that the blade</p>
<p>8: bolt community has quickly come to my aid. helping with everyone that must occur before the gamers gate to</p>
<p>thrycion is opened. thank you for believing me and thank you -" marcia raises a hand and steps in front</p>
<p>of stephen. "and the way that you can all help stephen the most right now is to let us go</p>
<p>upstairs to speak with damon. stephen cannot stay in one place too long, the fast we are in and out</p>
<p>of here the better chance we all have of travelling to thrycion soon. thank you! please, let us pass." disappointment</p>
<p>radiates through the crowd before they part and allow the two to pass through the wide, art spotted halls and</p>
<p>up the elegant stairs to the second floor. as they walk, marcia points and draws in just a few of</p>
<p>the many blade 8! bolt players in the mansion. they follower her as she leads stephen into large room that</p>
<p>is tight with workstations, server racks and a number of coders pointing and discussing a complex line chart on a</p>
<p>smartboard. damon, who seems to be the center of the conversation, wears a hoodie that looks too big for his</p>
<p>gaunt frame. "stephen, excellent. we can begin." he immediately returns to his workstation where a mac, a pc and a</p>
<p>linux netbook sit, connected to six screens. as he spins up applications, services and sites, marcia introduces stephen to everyone</p>
<p>in the room. "stephen, this is michael sventon, he is in charge of getting all the gear that is needed</p>
<p>for your communication streams; mobiles, computers, software; free, open source and purchased. this is tricia rivers. she is arranging for</p>
<p>transportation for all the mission critical tasks that need to be completed. this is delano ericson. he will be aggregating</p>
<p>the huge of amount of media information that is surrounding your return to thrycion. he can help you determine the</p>
<p>few stories you wish to respond to, if any, and keep the community informed of what is truth and what</p>
<p>is not. damon, here is in charge of your outgoing communications to everyone but the blade 8: bolt community. he</p>
<p>will be making sure that you can communicate out whatever you wish to whoever you wish with as much broadcast</p>
<p>or privacy as you desire, whenever, wherever you are." damon nods and stephen notices that his pupils are white, as</p>
<p>though he were blind. it takes stephen a meeting to realize these are cosmetic contacts. "first order of business is</p>
<p>getting a video out to the masses, correct?" stephen pulls an aeron chair and sits. "yes, how long after we</p>
<p>record will it take to distribute?" damon smiles, "i can have the video posted to viewtube within five meetings after</p>
<p>you finish. i have about 150 rpg sites ready to distribute whatever message you give in text, podcast, hd radio</p>
<p>and as many other electronic formats as you can think of. however, i think the trigger will be if it</p>
<p>is boing boinged pretty soon after its posted. from there it will spread like wildfire through blogosphere, web communities and</p>
<p>all the cross communities. larpers, comic fans, mmo crowd and the sci-fi community. they all have a lot of love</p>
<p>for the table-top rpg community, or at least respect. they will help." stephen nods. can we get started? i am</p>
<p>actually quite anxious to get this done." a thin goth brings a bottled water to him and damon rises from</p>
<p>the seat. stephen sits down in front of a stark white backdrop and marcia places the nikon dslr in front</p>
<p>of him. "go when you are ready." stephen sits on the stool in front on the black sheet backdrop, "hello,</p>
<p>my name is stephen cairnhist and i am college student at millersgrove university in lancaster, pa. since i was twelve</p>
<p>years old i have enjoyed the table-top roleplaying game blade and bolt. in addition to enjoying hundreds of hours of</p>
<p>gaming and gaining well over a dozen intelligent, imaginative friends, the game also opened up an area of scholarly pursuit</p>
<p>for me. i systematically learned every detail of every product published for blade and bolt. i also studied the life</p>
<p>of the creator of the game, christopher korbach, and how he brought his brilliant table-top roleplaying game to market. last</p>
<p>week, christopher korbach spoke at the largest gaming convention in the world, gamecon. he stated that blade and bolt was</p>
<p>not actually a game but instead an encyclopedia, a guide he had written for a world called thrycion. christopher korbach</p>
<p>declared that in 1I6I he traveled through a portal in mount gibbes, a peak in the black mountains of north</p>
<p>carolina. today, i am specifically speaking to the hundreds of thousands of b&b players in the united states of america</p>
<p>and throughout the world. please listen to me. thrycion, the world described in blade and bolt is absolutely real. now,</p>
<p>i need to make this crystal clear because people have accused our gaming culture of not being able to tell</p>
<p>reality from fantasy. thrycion is not a world made by magic with its source the blade and bolt rpg. thrycion</p>
<p>is real world, with real people, real creatures, real magic that christopher korbach discovered by going through the mount gibbes</p>
<p>portal. b&b is travel guide to a world as real as earth. make no mistake, what has occured is first</p>
<p>contact event. we now know that man is not alone in the universe, there are planets other than earth that</p>
<p>are populated by sentient life. ok. please keep that clear as you listen to me. thrycion is connected to</p>
