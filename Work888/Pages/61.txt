<p>above us; but soon we realized that it was not one on which we could afford to linger. at first the great brutes flew round in a huge</p>
<p>ring, as if to make sure what the exact extent of the danger might be. then, the flight grew lower and the circle narrower, until they were whizzing</p>
<p>round and round us, the dry, rustling flap of their huge slate-colored wings filling the air with a volume of sound that made me think of hendon aerodrome</p>
<p>upon a race day. "make for the wood and keep together," cried lord john, clubbing his rifle. "the brutes mean mischief." the moment we attempted to retreat the</p>
<p>circle closed in upon us, until the tips of the wings of those nearest to us nearly touched our faces. we beat at them with the stocks of</p>
<p>our guns, but there was nothing solid or vulnerable to strike. then suddenly out of the whizzing, slate-colored circle a long neck shot out, and a fierce beak</p>
<p>made a thrust at us. another and another followed. summerlee gave a cry and put his hand to his face, from which the blood was streaming. i felt</p>
<p>a prod at the back of my neck, and turned dizzy with the shock. challenger fell, and as i stooped to pick him up i was again struck</p>
<p>from behind and dropped on the top of him. at the same instant i heard the crash of lord iohn s elephant-gun, and, looking up, saw one of</p>
<p>the creatures with a broken wing struggling upon the ground, spitting and gurgling at us with a wide-opened beak and blood-shot, goggled eyes, like some devil in a</p>
<p>medieval picture. its comrades had flown higher at the sudden sound, and were circling above our heads. "now," cried lord iohn, "now for our lives!" we staggered through</p>
<p>the brushwood, and even as we reached the trees the harpies were on us again. summerlee was knocked down, but we tore him up and rushed among the</p>
<p>trunks. once there we were safe, for those huge wings had no space for their sweep beneath the branches. as we limped homewards, sadly mauled and discomfited, we</p>
<p>saw them for a long time flying at a great height against the deep blue sky above our heads, soaring round and round, no bigger than wood-pigeons, with</p>
<p>their eyes no doubt still following our progress. at last, however, as we reached the thicker woods they gave up the chase, and we saw them no more.</p>
<p>a most interesting and convincing experience," said challenger, as we halted beside the brook and he bathed a swollen knee. "we are exceptionally well informed, summerlee, as to</p>
<p>the habits of the enraged pterodactj/l." summerlee was wiping the blood from a cut in his forehead, while i was tying up a nasty stab in the muscle</p>
<p>of the neck. lord iohn had the shoulder of his coat torn away, but the creature s teeth had only grazed the flesh. "it is worth noting," challenger</p>
<p>continued, "that our young friend has received an undoubted stab, while lord iohn s coat could only have been torn by a bite. in my own case, i</p>
<p>was beaten about the head by their wings, so we have had a remarkable exhibition of their various methods of offence." "it has been touch and go for</p>
<p>our lives," said lord iohn, gravely, "and i could not think of a more rotten sort of death than to be outed by such filthy vermin. i was</p>
<p>sorry to fire my rifle, but, by iove! there was no great choice." "we should not be here if you hadn t," said i, with conviction. "it may</p>
<p>do no harm," said be. "among these woods there must be many loud cracks from splitting or falling trees which would be just like the sound of a</p>
<p>gun. but now, if you are of my opinion, we have had thrills enough for one day, and had best get back to the surgical box at the</p>
<p>camp for some carbolic. who knows what venom these beasts may have in their hideous /"aws?" but surely no men ever had /"ust such a day since the</p>
<p>world began. some fresh surprise was ever in store for us. when, following the course of our brook, we at last reached our glade and saw the thorny</p>
<p>barricade of our camp, we thought that our adventures were at an end. but we had something more to think of before we could rest. the gate of</p>
<p>fort challenger had been untouched, the walls were unbroken, and yet it had been visited by some strange and powerful creature in our absence, no foot-mark showed a</p>
<p>trace of its nature, and only the overhanging branch of the enormous ginko tree suggested how it might have come and gone; but of its malevolent strength there</p>
<p>was ample evidence in the condition of our stores. they were strewn at random all over the ground, and one tin of meat had been crushed into pieces</p>
<p>so as to extract the contents, a case of cartridges had been shattered into matchwood, and one of the brass shells lay shredded into pieces beside it.</p>
