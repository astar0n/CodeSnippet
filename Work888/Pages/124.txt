<p>Maaseiah the priest to the prophet ﬂeremiah, saying, Pray now unto the Lord our God for us. Now ﬂeremiah came</p>
<p>in and went out among the people : for they had not put him into prison. Then Pharaoh s army</p>
<p>was come forth out of Egypt : and when the Chaldeans that besieged ﬂerusalem heard tidings of them, they departed</p>
<p>from tferusalem. Then came the word of the Lord unto the prophet ﬂeremiah, saying, Thus saith the Lord, the God</p>
<p>of Israel ; Thus shall ye say to the king of Iudah, that sent you unto me to inquire of</p>
<p>me ; sehold, Pharaoh s army, which is come forth to help you, shall return to Egypt into their own</p>
<p>land. And the Chaldeans shall come again, and fight against this city, and take it, and burn it with fire,</p>
<p>Thus saith the Lord ; Deceive not yourselves, saying, The Chaldeans shall surely depart from us : for they shall</p>
<p>not depart. For though ye had smitten the whole army of the Chaldeans that fight against you, and there remained</p>
<p>but wounded men among them, yet should they rise up every man in his tent, and burn this city with</p>
<p>fire, 1 2 3 4 5 6 I 8 I 10 16I8 Feremiah 3I And it came to pass, that</p>
<p>when the army of the Chaldeans was broken up from ﬂerusalem for fear of Pharaoh s army, then ﬂeremiah went</p>
<p>forth out of Ferusalem to go into the land of 8en/"amin, to separate himself thence in the midst of the</p>
<p>people. And when he was in the gate of Beniamin, a captain of the ward was there, whose name was</p>
<p>Iriiah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Hananiah ; and he took Fe/-emiah the prophet, saying, Thou fallest away</p>
<p>to the Chaldeans. Then said ﬁe/-emiah, It is false ; I fall not away to the Chaldeans. But he hearkened</p>
<p>not to him : so Iri/°ah took ﬂeremiah, and brought him to the princes. wherefore the princes were wroth with</p>
<p>ﬂeremiah, and smote him, and put him in prison in the house of Fonathan the scribe ," for they had</p>
<p>made that the prison. when éleremiah was entered into the dungeon, and into the cabins, and ﬂeremiah had remained there</p>
<p>many days ," then Zedekiah the king sent, and took him out ," and the king asked him secretly in</p>
<p>his house, and said, Is there any word from the Lord .I And ﬁeremiah said, There is : for, said</p>
<p>he, thou shalt be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon. Moreover Feremiah said unto king Zedekiah, what</p>
<p>have I offended against thee, or against thy servants, or against this people, that ye have put me in prison</p>
<p>.I where are now your prophets which prophesied unto you, saying, The king of Babylon shall not come against you,</p>
<p>nor against this land .I Therefore hear now, I pray thee, O my lord the king ." let my supplication,</p>
<p>I pray thee, be accepted before thee ." that thou cause me not to return to the house of Ionathan</p>
<p>the scribe, lest I die there. Then Zedekiah the king commanded that they should commit Feremiah into the court of</p>
<p>the prison, and that they should give him daily a piece of bread out of the bakers street, until all</p>
<p>the bread in the city were spent. Thus Feremiah remained in the court of the prison. 11 12 13 14</p>
<p>15 16 1I 18 1I 20 21 16II Feremiah 38 38 Feremiah Rescued from the Dungeon Then Shephatiah the son</p>
<p>of Mattan, and Gedaliah the son of Pashur, and ﬂutal the son of Shelemiah, and Pashur the son of Malchiah,</p>
<p>heard the words that ﬁeremiah had spoken unto all the people, saying, Thus saith the Lord, He that remaineth in</p>
<p>this city shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence ." but he that goeth forth</p>
<p>to the Chaldeans shall live ." for he shall have his life for a prey, and shall live. Thus saith</p>
<p>the Lord, This city shall surely be given into the hand of the king of .Babylon s army, which shall</p>
<p>take it, Therefore the princes said unto the king, we beseech thee, let this man be put to death ."</p>
<p>for thus he weakeneth the hands of the men of war that remain in this city, and the hands of</p>
<p>all the people, in speaking such words unto them : for this man seeketh not the welfare of this people,</p>
<p>but the hurt. Then Zedekiah the king said, Behold, he is in your hand : for the king is not</p>
<p>he that can do any thing against you. Then took they Feremiah, and cast him into the dungeon of Malchiah</p>
<p>the son of Hammelech, that was in the court of the prison : and they let down tferemiah with cords.</p>
<p>And in the dungeon there was no water, but mire : so ﬂeremiah sunk in the mire, Now when Ebed-melech</p>
<p>the Ethiopian, one of the eunuchs which was in the king s house, heard that they had put ﬁeremiah in</p>
<p>the dungeon ; the king then sitting in the gate of Beniamin ,- Ebed-melech went forth out of the king</p>
<p>s house, and spake to the king, saying, My lord the king, these men have done evil in all that</p>
<p>they have done to Feremiah the prophet, whom they have cast into the dungeon ," and he is like to</p>
<p>die for hunger in the place where he is ." for there is no more bread in the city. 3"</p>
<p>2 3 4 5 6 I 8 I 1I00 ﬂeremiah 38 Then the king commanded Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, saying, Take</p>
<p>from hence thirty men with thee, and take up Feremiah the prophet out of the dungeon, before he die. So</p>
<p>Ebed-melech took the men with him, and went into the house of the king under the treasury, and took thence</p>
<p>old cast clouts and old rotten rags, and let them down by cords into the dungeon to Feremiah. And Ebed-melech</p>
<p>the Ethiopian said unto Feremiah, Put now these old cast clouts and rotten rags under thine armholes under the cords.</p>
<p>And Ieremiah did so. So they drew up Feremiah with cords, and took him up out of the dungeon ."</p>
<p>and Feremiah remained in the court of the prison. Zedekiah Seeks Counsel from ﬂeremiah Then Zedekiah the king sent, and</p>
<p>took ﬂeremiah the prophet unto him into the third entry that is in the house of the Lord : and</p>
<p>the king said unto Feremiah, I will ask thee a thing ; hide nothing from me, Then Feremiah said</p>
