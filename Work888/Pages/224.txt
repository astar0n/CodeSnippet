<p>some unknown visitor, the reader walked with a slow sure step, avoiding attention, carefully navigating the most unobtrusive path. at</p>
<p>this moment, that was no longer the case. he now stepped fervently, caring little for crowds or gawking onlookers. mappel</p>
<p>could only surmise that the reader held great expectations for the new arrival announced by the woman follower of godson.</p>
<p>"is he inside?" the reader asked rachael with near booming exuberance as the group reached the steps of the church.</p>
<p>"yes, he s in your chambers." matthew turned and ran up the stone stairs, his feet passing beyond every other</p>
<p>step. he grabbed the door and yanked it open. it swung to its full length before it thudded against the</p>
<p>stone door stop. it vibrated for but a moment, until its own great weight brought it to a motionless halt.</p>
<p>matthew was through the door in but a heartbeat. before another such beat, he had already vanished beyond the line</p>
<p>of sight of those that followed. rachael also moved quickly up the stairs. she grabbed the door handle, but waited</p>
<p>patiently for the two strangers to follow her inside before she swung it closed. once all were inside, she set</p>
<p>off down a small corridor and disappeared through a door in a far back corner of the church. mappel and</p>
<p>lief looked about curiously. the main room of worship now contained several more anxious people. they totaled barely more than</p>
<p>a dozen, but their whispers buzzed with excitement and sent an echoing hum through the rafters. in comparison to the</p>
<p>space available to them within this building which was more like a fortress than a church, their number appeared meager</p>
<p>at best. they could no more fill the many benches which lined the open space than mappel s camp of</p>
<p>elves could fill the branches of all the trees in dark spruce forest, yet, from what the elder elf remembered</p>
<p>of matthew s words, this must represent a great ma/"ority of the church s followers. those within barely heeded the</p>
<p>arrival of the elves. in fact if either lief or mappel had removed their caps, it was doubtful that any</p>
<p>would have noticed. instead, they chattered nervously, excitedly among themselves. they looked pensively toward the hallway which led to matthew</p>
<p>s personal chamber. "what should we do?" lief asked softly while keeping a watchful eye on the people that continued</p>
<p>to ignore them. "let us move to a seat in the back where we will remain inconspicuous to these people.</p>
<p>i assume the reader will summon us when the time is proper." the church members paid them no mind. their</p>
<p>attention remained centered upon the passage to matthew s chamber. both elves took satisfaction in the small respite, and neither</p>
<p>felt at all uneasy with the present number of humans, a humble and unassuming lot. lief took the opportunity to</p>
<p>look about the large open space which represented the heart of the church. for the most part, it remained simple.</p>
<p>it was void of any relics or symbols which might connect it to the faith of godson. the walls, made</p>
<p>of powerful stone, rose up to the thick wooden rafters of the roof. the benches stood aligned with a walkway</p>
<p>down the center, leading away from the front door. at the path s end, a simple platform stood innocuously and</p>
<p>just high enough to allow a clear view of a speaker. lief s further inspection was cut short by the</p>
<p>sudden appearance of the reader. he broke from the passageway into the vast open space alone. he took but a</p>
<p>few steps toward the center before stopping to address the other followers who immediately ceased their chatter. "friends, it is</p>
<p>not my intention to keep things from you. i would have you all involved with what must be considered, if</p>
<p>i could. unfortunately, i am not even sure if it is my place to be included in what must be</p>
<p>discussed here today. please bear with me for but a few moments." the reader turned, but not back to his</p>
<p>chamber. after scanning the room, his eyes fell upon the two seated in the back. he moved to them almost</p>
<p>as quickly as he raced up the steps of the church. he leaned over mappel and whispered so as no</p>
<p>one else could hear. as the other church members watched silently, mappel nodded and made but a passing remark to</p>
<p>his companion. lief rose and headed to a side door which rachael had previously used. in but a moment, he</p>
<p>was behind a closed door. it was time for him to send word to the elf sentries of dark spruce.</p>
<p>upon lief s exit, mappel turned his head back to the reader. they exchanged messages inaudible to the others. he</p>
<p>then stood and followed matthew to the center of the room, to within the very midst of the other followers.</p>
<p>they gathered around the elf and the reader curiously, expectantly. it was mappel who spoke. he stood still, his hands</p>
<p>gently clasping his staff. only his head turned about to meet the questioning gazes of those that now surrounded him.</p>
<p>"do not blame the reader for keeping you in the dark over what has been happening here. it was never</p>
<p>his intention to hide anything from you. if you must blame someone of that, blame me. i will tell you</p>
<p>now, what only a select others might know. you will understand, for your following allows you an appreciation for the</p>
<p>land as it was." he tried not to pause, but he could not help stopping to inhale deeply before speaking</p>
<p>his next sentence. "the sphere of ingar has broken free from its entombment, and the magic has returned to the</p>
<p>land." mumblings erupted, but soon all quieted to hear further explanation. mappel held them calm with his reassuring voice and</p>
<p>patient eyes. "i know you will find this difficult to accept, i have been told such a thing has not</p>
<p>been prophesied for you. i can only say that such an event was also not included in elflore. i</p>
