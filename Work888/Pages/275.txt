<p>and long hops now." "medium right," suggested smith, with the intense gravity which comes upon a varsity man when he speaks of athletics. "inclining to fast, with a</p>
<p>work from leg. comes with the arm about three inches or so. he used to be nasty on a wet wicket. oh, by-the-way, have you heard about long</p>
<p>norton?" "what s that?" "he s been attacked." "attacked?" "yes, just as he was turning out of the high street, and within a hundred yards of the gate</p>
<p>of old s." "but who----" "ah, that s the rub! if you said what, you would be more grammatical. norton swears that it was not human, and, indeed,</p>
<p>from the scratches on his throat, i should be inclined to agree with him." "what, then? have we come down to spooks?" abercrombie smith puffed his scientific contempt,</p>
<p>"well, no; i don t think that is quite the idea, either. i am inclined to think that if any showman has lost a great ape lately, and</p>
<p>the brute is in these parts, a iury would find a true bill against it. norton passes that way every night, you know, about the same hour. there</p>
<p>s a tree that hangs low over the path--the big elm from rainy s garden. norton thinks the thing dropped on him out of the tree. anyhow, he</p>
<p>was nearly strangled by two arms, which, he says, were as strong and as thin as steel bands. he saw nothing; only those beastly arms that tightened and</p>
<p>tightened on him. he yelled his head nearly off, and a couple of chaps came running, and the thing went over the wall like a cat. he never</p>
<p>got a fair sight of it the whole time. it gave norton a shake up, i can tell you. i tell him it has been as good as</p>
<p>a change at the sea-side for him." "a garrotter, most likely," said smith. "very possibly. norton says not; but we don t mind what he says. the garrotter</p>
<p>had long nails, and was pretty smart at swinging himself over walls. by-the-way, your beautiful neighbour would be pleased if he heard about it. he had a grudge</p>
<p>against norton, and he s not a man, from what i know of him, to forget his little debts. but hallo, old chap, what have you got in</p>
<p>your noddle?" "nothing," smith answered curtly. he had started in his chair, and the look had flashed over his face which comes upon a man who is struck</p>
<p>suddenly by some unpleasant idea. "you looked as if something i had said had taken you on the raw. by-the-way, you have made the acquaintance of master b.</p>
<p>since i looked in last, have you not? young monkhouse lee told me something to that effect." "yes; i know him slightly. he has been up here once</p>
<p>or twice." "well, you re big enough and ugly enough to take care of yourself. he s not what i should call exactly a healthy sort of Johnny,</p>
<p>though, no doubt, he s very clever, and all that. but you ll soon find out for yourself. lee is all right; he s a very decent little</p>
<p>fellow. well, so long, old chap! i row mullins for the vice-chancellor s pot on wednesday week, so mind you come down, in case i don t see</p>
<p>you before." bovine smith laid down his pipe and turned stolidly to his books once more. but with all the will in the world, he found it very</p>
<p>hard to keep his mind upon his work. it would slip away to brood upon the man beneath him, and upon the little mystery which hung round his</p>
<p>chambers. then his thoughts turned to this singular attack of which hastie had spoken, and to the grudge which bellingham was said to owe the object of it.</p>
<p>the two ideas would persist in rising together in his mind, as though there were some close and intimate connection between them. and yet the suspicion was so</p>
<p>dim and vague that it could not be put down in words. "confound the chap!" cried smith, as he shied his book on pathology across the room. "he</p>
<p>has spoiled my night s reading, and that s reason enough, if there were no other, why i should steer clear of him in the future." for ten</p>
<p>days the medical student confined himself so closely to his studies that he neither saw nor heard anything of either of the men beneath him. at the hours</p>
<p>when bellingham had been accustomed to visit him, he took care to sport his oak, and though he more than once heard a knocking at his outer door,</p>
<p>he resolutely refused to answer it. one afternoon, however, he was descending the stairs when, just as he was passing it, bellingham s door flew open, and young</p>
<p>monkhouse lee came out with his eyes sparkling and a dark flush of anger upon his olive cheeks, close at his heels followed bellingham, his fat, unhealthy face</p>
<p>all quivering with malignant passion. "you fool!" he hissed. "you ll be sorry." "very likely," cried the other. "mind what i say. it s off! i won</p>
