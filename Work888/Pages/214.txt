<p>for her children, and would not be comforted, because they are not. But when Herod was dead, behold, an angel</p>
<p>of the Lord appeareth in a dream to ﬂoseph in Egypt, saying, Arise, and take the young child and his</p>
<p>mother, and go into the land of Israel : for they are dead which sought the young child s life.</p>
<p>And he arose, and took the young child and his mother, and came into the land of Vsrael. But when</p>
<p>he heard that Archelaus did reign in iludea in the room of his father Herod, he was afraid to go</p>
<p>thither : notwithstanding, being warned of God in a dream, he turned aside into the parts of Galilee ." 13</p>
<p>14 15 16 1I 18 1I 20 21 22 2015 Matthew 3 and he came and dwelt in a city</p>
<p>called Nazareth : that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, He shall be called a Nazarene.</p>
<p>3 The Preaching of Iohn the Baptist "in those days came ﬂohn the Baptist, preaching in the wilderness of Fudea,</p>
<p>and saying, Repent ye : for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. For this is he that was spoken</p>
<p>of by the prophet Vsaiah, saying, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the</p>
<p>Lord, make his paths straight. And the same ﬂohn had his raiment of camel s hair, and a leathern girdle</p>
<p>about his loins ," and his meat was locusts and wild honey. Then went out to him ﬂerusalem, and all</p>
<p>iludea, and all the region round about ilordan, and were baptized of him in Fordan, confessing their sins. But when</p>
<p>he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come to his baptism, he said unto them, 0 generation of vipers,</p>
<p>who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come ? Bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance :</p>
<p>and think not to say within yourselves, we have Abraham to our father ." for I say unto you, that</p>
<p>God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham. And now also the axe is laid unto</p>
<p>the root of the trees : therefore every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast</p>
<p>into the fire. "I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance : but he that cometh after me is mightier</p>
<p>than "I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear : he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and</p>
<p>with fire : 23 1 2 3 4 5 6 I 8 I 10 11 2016 Matthew 4 whose fan</p>
<p>is in his hand, and he will thoroughly purge his floor, and gather his wheat into the garner ." but</p>
<p>he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire. The Baptism of ilesus Then cometh ilesus from Galilee to ilordan</p>
<p>unto ﬂohn, to be baptized of him. But Fohn forbade him, saying, "i have need to be baptized of thee,</p>
<p>and comest thou to me ." And ilesus answering said unto him, Suffer it to be so now ." for</p>
<p>thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness. Then he suffered him. And Fesus, when he was baptized, went up</p>
<p>straightway out of the water : and, lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of</p>
<p>God descending like a dove, and lighting upon him : and lo a voice from heaven, saying, This is my</p>
<p>beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. 4 The Temptation of Fesus Then was ﬂesus led up of the</p>
<p>Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil. And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights,</p>
<p>he was afterward ahungered. And when the tempter came to him, he said, "if thou be the Son of God,</p>
<p>command that these stones be made bread. But he answered and said, "It is written, Man shall not live by</p>
<p>bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God. Then the devil taketh him up</p>
<p>into the holy city, and setteth him on a pinnacle of the temple, and saith unto him, If thou be</p>
<p>the Son of God, cast thyself down : for it is written, 12 13 14 15 16 1I 1 2</p>
<p>3 4 5 6 201I Matthew 4 He shall give his angels charge concerning thee : and in their hands</p>
<p>they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone. iesus said unto him,</p>
<p>"it is written again, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God. Again, the devil taketh him up into an</p>
<p>exceeding high mountain, and showeth him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them ; and saith</p>
<p>unto him, All these things will "I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me. Then saith iesus</p>
<p>unto him, Get thee hence, Satan ." for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him</p>
<p>only shalt thou serve. Then the devil leaveth him, and, behold, angels came and ministered unto him. Fesus Begins His</p>
<p>Ministry Now when ilesus had heard that ilohn was cast into prison, he departed into Galilee ." and leaving Nazareth,</p>
<p>he came and dwelt in Capernaum, which is upon the seacoast, in the borders of Zebulun and Naphtali : that</p>
<p>it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet, saying, The land of Zebulun, and the land of</p>
<p>Naphtali, by the way of the sea, beyond ilordan, Galilee of the Gentiles ; the people which sat in darkness</p>
<p>saw great light ," and to them which sat in the region and shadow of death light is sprung up.</p>
<p>From that time ﬁesus began to preach, and to say, Repent : for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.</p>
<p>I 3 I 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 1I 2018 Matthew 5 ﬂesus calls Four Fishermen And eesus,</p>
<p>walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brethren, Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into</p>
<p>the sea : for they were fishers. And he saith unto them, Follow me, and "I will make you fishers</p>
<p>of men, And they straightway left their nets, and followed him. And going on from thence, he saw other two</p>
<p>brethren, ﬂames the son of Zebedee, and iohn his brother, in a ship with Zebedee their father, mending their nets</p>
<p>; and he called them. And they immediately left the ship and their father, and followed him. Fesus Ministers to</p>
<p>a Great Multitude And ilesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the</p>
