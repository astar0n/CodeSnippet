<p>cried, "it doesn t matter what our friends say, i still hope, and will always hope. a man like my</p>
<p>father doesn t die till he has finished his work." mary grant could not reply. sobs choked her voice, a</p>
<p>thousand feelings struggled in her breast at the news that fresh attempts were about to be made to recover harry</p>
<p>grant, and that the devotion of the captain was so unbounded. "and does mr. iohn still hope?" she asked, "yes,"</p>
<p>replied robert. "he is a brother that will never forsake us, never! i will be a sailor, you ll say</p>
<p>yes, won t you, sister? and let me ioin him in looking for my father. i am sure you are</p>
<p>willing." "yes, i am willing," said mary. "but the separation!" she murmured. "you will not be alone, mary, i know</p>
<p>that. my friend iohn told me so. lady helena will not let you leave her. you are a woman," you</p>
<p>can and should accept her kindness. to refuse would be ungrateful, but a man, my father has said a hundred</p>
<p>times, must make his own way." "but what will become of our own dear home in dundee, so full of</p>
<p>memories?" "we will keep it, little sister! all that is settled, and settled so well, by our friend iohn, and</p>
<p>also by lord glenarvan. he is to keep you at malcolm castle as if you were his daughter. my lord</p>
<p>told my friend iohn so, and he told me. you will be at home there, and have someone to speak</p>
<p>to about our father, while you are waiting till iohn and i bring him back to you some day. ah!</p>
<p>what a grand day that will be!" exclaimed robert, his face glowing with enthusiasm. "my boy, my brother," replied mary,</p>
<p>"how happy my father would be if he could hear you. how much you are like him, dear robert, like</p>
<p>our dear, dear father. when you grow up you ll be just himself." "i hope i may," said robert, blushing</p>
<p>with filial and sacred pride. "but how shall we requite lord and lady glenarvan?" said mary grant. "oh, that will</p>
<p>not be difficult," replied robert, with boyish confidence. "we will love and revere them, and we will tell them so;</p>
<p>and we will give them plenty of kisses, and some day, when we can get the chance, we will die</p>
<p>for them." "we ll live for them, on the contrary," replied the young girl, covering her brother s forehead with</p>
<p>kisses. "they will like that better, and so shall i." the two children then relapsed into silence, gazing out into</p>
<p>the dark night, and giving way to long reveries, interrupted occasionally by a question or remark from one to the</p>
<p>other. a long swell undulated the surface of the calm sea, and the screw turned up a luminous furrow in</p>
<p>the darkness. a strange and altogether supernatural incident now occurred. the brother and sister, by some of those magnetic communications</p>
<p>which link souls mysteriously together, were the subjects at the same time and the same instant of the same hallucination,</p>
<p>out of the midst of these waves, with their alternations of light and shadow, a deep plaintive voice sent up</p>
<p>a cry, the tones of which thrilled through even fiber of their being. "come! come!" were the words which fell</p>
<p>on their ears. they both started up and leaned over the railing, and peered into the gloom with questioning eyes.</p>
<p>"mary, you heard that? you heard that?" cried robert. but they saw nothing but the long shadow that stretched before</p>
<p>them. "robert," said mary, pale with emotion, "i thought--yes, i thought as you did, that--we must both be ill with</p>
<p>fever, robert." a second time the cry reached them, and this time the illusion was so great, that they both</p>
<p>exclaimed simultaneously, "my father! my father!" it was too much for mary. overcome with emotion, she fell fainting into robert</p>
<p>s arms. "help!" shouted robert. "my sister! my father! help! help!" the man at the wheel darted forward to lift</p>
<p>up the girl. the sailors on watch ran to assist, and John mangles, lady helena, and glenarvan were hastily roused</p>
<p>from sleep. "my sister is dying, and my father is there!" exclaimed robert, pointing to the waves. they were wholly</p>
<p>at a loss to understand him. "yes!" he repeated, "my father is there! i heard my father s voice; mary</p>
<p>heard it too!" just at this moment, mary grant recovering consciousness, but wandering and excited, called out, "my father! my</p>
<p>father is there!" and the poor girl started up, and leaning over the side of the yacht, wanted to throw</p>
<p>herself into the sea. "my lord--lady helena!" she exclaimed, clasping her hands, "i tell you my father is there! i</p>
<p>can declare that i heard his voice come out of the waves like a wail, as if it were a</p>
<p>last adieu." the young girl went off again into convulsions and spasms, which became so violent that she had to</p>
<p>be carried to her cabin, where lady helena lavished even care on her. robert kept on repeating, "my father! my</p>
<p>father is there! i am sure of it, my lord!" the spectators of this painful scene saw that the captain</p>
<p>s children were laboring under an hallucination. but how were they to be undeceived? glenarvan made an attempt, however. he</p>
<p>took robert s hand, and said, "you say you heard your father s voice, my dear boy?" "yes, my lord;</p>
<p>there, in the middle of the waves. he cried out, come! come! " "and did you recognize his voice?" "yes,</p>
<p>i recognized it immediately. yes, yes; i can swear to it! my sister heard it, and recognized it as well.</p>
<p>how could we both be deceived? my lord, do let us go to my father s help. a boat! a</p>
<p>boat!" glenarvan saw it was impossible to undeceive the poor boy, but he tried once more by saying to the</p>
<p>man at the wheel: "hawkins, you were at the wheel, were you not, when miss mary was so strangely</p>
